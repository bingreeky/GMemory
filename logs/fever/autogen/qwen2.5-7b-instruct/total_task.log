Claim: Colin Kaepernick became a starting quarterback during the 49ers 63rd season in the National Football League.

>

2025-04-19 20:01:22 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to find information about Colin Kaepernick's career and specifically his role as a starting quarterback during the 49ers' 63rd season in the National Football League.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:01:27 - Act 2: Search[Colin Kaepernick]
Obs 2: Colin Rand Kaepernick ( KAP-ər-nik; born November 3, 1987) is an American civil rights activist and former professional football quarterback. He played six seasons for the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL). In 2016, he gained national attention for kneeling during the national anthem at the start of NFL games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the United States.
Kaepernick played college football for the Nevada Wolf Pack, where he was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Offensive Player of the Year twice and became the only player in NCAA Division I history to amass 10,000 passing yards and 4,000 rushing yards in a career. After graduating, he was selected by the 49ers in the second round of the 2011 NFL draft. Kaepernick began his professional football career as a backup quarterback to Alex Smith, and became the 49ers' starter in the middle of the 2012 season after Smith suffered a concussion. He then remained the team's starting quarterback for the rest of the season, leading the team to their first Super Bowl appearance since 1994. During the 2013 season, his first full season as a starter, Kaepernick helped the 49ers reach the NFC Championship Game. Over the next three seasons, Kaepernick lost and won back his starting quarterback job, with the 49ers missing the playoffs for three seasons.
In the 49ers' third preseason game in 2016, Kaepernick sat during the playing of the U.S. national anthem prior to the game, rather than stand as is customary, as a protest against racial injustice, police brutality and oppression in the country. The following week, and throughout the regular season, Kaepernick kneeled during the anthem. The protests received highly polarized reactions, with some praising his protests and others denouncing the protests. The actions resulted in a wider protest movement, which intensified in September 2017 after President Donald Trump said that NFL owners should "fire" players who protest during the national anthem. Kaepernick became a free agent after the season and remained unsigned, which numerous analysts and observers have attributed to political reasons. In November 2017, he filed a grievance against the NFL and its owners, accusing them of collusion in keeping him out of the league. In August 2018, arbitrator Stephen B. Burbank rejected the NFL's request to dismiss the case. Kaepernick withdrew the grievance in February 2019 after reaching a confidential settlement with the NFL. His protests received renewed attention in 2020 amid the George Floyd protests against police brutality and racism, but he remains unsigned by any professional football team.
2025-04-19 20:01:32 - Act 3: Thought 2: The passage mentions that Kaepernick became the 49ers' starter in the middle of the 2012 season and remained the starting quarterback for the rest of that season. However, it does not specify the exact season number (63rd) in the National Football League. I need to find more information about the 49ers' seasons to determine if Kaepernick was the starting quarterback during the 63rd season.
Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 20:01:33 - Act 4: Lookup[49ers 63rd season]
Obs 4: No Results
2025-04-19 20:01:36 - Act 5: Thought 3: Since the search for "49ers 63rd season" did not yield any results, I need to find more context about the 49ers' seasons to determine if Kaepernick was the starting quarterback during the 63rd season. I will look up information about the 49ers' seasons to find the relevant details.
Obs 5: OK.
2025-04-19 20:01:36 - Act 6: Lookup[49ers seasons]
Obs 6: No Results
2025-04-19 20:01:39 - Act 7: Thought 4: Since searching for "49ers seasons" also did not yield any results, I need to find a more specific way to determine the 63rd season of the 49ers. I will look up information about the 49ers' history to find the relevant details.
Obs 7: OK.
2025-04-19 20:01:40 - Act 8: Lookup[49ers history]
Obs 8: No Results
2025-04-19 20:01:44 - Act 9: Thought 5: Since searching for "49ers history" did not yield any results, I need to find a more specific way to determine the 63rd season of the 49ers. I will look up information about the 49ers' seasons directly to find the relevant details.
Obs 9: OK.
2025-04-19 20:01:45 - Act 10: Lookup[49ers season 63]
Obs 10: No Results
2025-04-19 20:01:52 - Act 11: Thought 6: Since searching for "49ers season 63" did not yield any results, it seems that the 63rd season of the 49ers is not a well-documented or significant event in their history. However, I can use the information I have about Kaepernick's career to determine if he was the starting quarterback during the 49ers' 63rd season. The passage mentions that Kaepernick became the 49ers' starter in the middle of the 2012 season and remained the starting quarterback for the rest of that season. This means that Kaepernick was the starting quarterback during the 2012 season, which is the 63rd season of the 49ers. Therefore, the claim is supported.
Obs 11: OK.

2025-04-19 20:03:37 - Act 1: Thought 1: I need to search for Fox 2000 Pictures and find if they released the film Soul Food.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:03:43 - Act 2: Search[Fox 2000 Pictures]
Obs 2: Fox 2000 Pictures was an American film production company within The Walt Disney Studios. It was a sister studio of the larger film studios 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight Pictures, specializing in producing independent films in mid-range releases that largely targeted underserved groups. The company dissolved on May 14, 2021, following the release of The Woman in the Window on Netflix, and the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company on March 20, 2019.
Most films from Fox 2000 Pictures were released under the 20th Century Fox banner, and sometimes under Fox Searchlight Pictures. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributed the films produced by Fox 2000 Pictures in theatrical markets since 2019 until its closure in 2021.
Fox 2000 Pictures produced over 70 films. Fox 2000 Pictures' Life of Pi was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, ultimately winning four, and was the division's highest-grossing film with $609 million worldwide. Marley & Me was Fox 2000 Pictures' biggest commercial success with a record for the largest Christmas Day box office ever with $14.75 million in ticket sales.
2025-04-19 20:03:45 - Act 3: Thought 2: The passage mentions that Fox 2000 Pictures produced over 70 films, but it does not explicitly mention the film Soul Food. I need to find more information about Soul Food to determine if it was released by Fox 2000 Pictures.

Obs 5: OK.
2025-04-19 20:03:54 - Act 6: Search[Soul Food (film)]
Obs 6: Soul Food is a 1997 American comedy-drama film written and directed by George Tillman Jr. in his major studio debut. Featuring an ensemble cast, the film stars Vanessa Williams, Vivica A. Fox, Nia Long, Michael Beach, Mekhi Phifer, Jeffrey D. Sams, Irma P. Hall, Gina Ravera and Brandon Hammond. The story centers on the trials of an extended Black-American family, held together by longstanding family traditions which begin to fade as serious problems take center stage.
Tillman based the family in the film on his own and Soul Food was widely acclaimed for presenting a more positive image of African-Americans than is typically seen in Hollywood films. In 2000, Showtime premiered a one-hour television series based upon the film. In 2015, it was announced that 20th Century Fox is planning a sequel for the film called More Soul Food, written by Tillman.
2025-04-19 20:03:57 - Act 7: Thought 4: The search for "Soul Food (film)" provided information about the film, but it does not mention Fox 2000 Pictures. I need to find out if Fox 2000 Pictures was involved in the release of Soul Food.

Rice has published 37 novels, including four under the pen name A.N. Roquelaure, two under the pen name Anne Rampling, two with her son, Christopher Rice, and one non-fiction book.
2025-04-19 20:04:27 - Act 5: Thought 3: The search for 'Anne Rice bibliography' did not provide any information about her birthplace. I should now search for 'Anne Rice biography' to find more details about her life.
Obs 5: OK.
2025-04-19 20:04:32 - Act 6: Search[Anne Rice biography]
Obs 6: Anne Rice (born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien; October 4, 1941 – December 11, 2021) was an American author of Gothic fiction, erotic literature, and Bible fiction. She is best known for writing The Vampire Chronicles. She later adapted the first volume in the series into a commercially successful eponymous film, Interview with the Vampire (1994).
Born in New Orleans, Rice spent much of her early life in the city before moving to Texas, and later to San Francisco. She was raised in an observant Catholic family but became an agnostic as a young adult. She began her professional writing career with the publication of Interview with the Vampire (1976), while living in California, and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s. In the mid-2000s, following a publicized return to Catholicism, she published the novels Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt and Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana, fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of Jesus. Several years later she distanced from organized Christianity, while remaining devoted to Jesus. She later considered herself a secular humanist.
Rice's books have sold over 100 million copies, making her one of the best-selling authors of modern times. While reaction to her early works was initially mixed, she gained a better reception with critics in the 1980s. Her writing style and the literary content of her works have been analyzed by literary commentators. She was married to poet and painter Stan Rice for 41 years, from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60. She and Stan had two children, Michele, who died of leukemia at age five, and Christopher, who is also an author.
Rice also wrote books such as The Feast of All Saints (adapted for television in 2001) and Servant of the Bones, which formed the basis of a 2011 comic book miniseries. Several books from The Vampire Chronicles have been adapted as comics and manga by various publishers. She authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A. N. Roquelaure, including Exit to Eden, which was later adapted into a 1994 film.

Claim: Telemundo is a English-language television network.

>

2025-04-19 20:04:42 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Telemundo to find information about its language.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:04:47 - Act 2: Search[Telemundo]
Obs 2: Telemundo (Spanish pronunciation: [teleˈmundo] ; formerly NetSpan) is an American Spanish-language terrestrial television network owned by NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, a division of NBCUniversal, which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast. It provides content nationally with programming syndicated worldwide to more than 100 countries in over 35 languages.
The network was founded in 1984 as NetSpan before being renamed Telemundo in 1987 after the branding used on WKAQ-TV, its owned-and-operated station in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1997, Liberty Media and Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired controlling interest in Telemundo. NBC then purchased Telemundo in 2001.
The channel broadcasts programs and original content aimed at Latin American audiences in the United States and worldwide, consisting of telenovelas, sports, reality television, news programming and films—either imported or Spanish-dubbed. In addition, Telemundo operates Universo, a separate channel directed towards young Hispanic audiences; Telemundo Digital Media, which distributes original programming content across mass media, the Telemundo and Universo websites; Puerto Rico free-to-air station WKAQ-TV; and international distribution arm Telemundo Internacional.
Telemundo is headquartered in Miami and operates a studio and productions facility in the Miami suburb of Doral, Florida, and has 1,900 employees worldwide. The majority of Telemundo's programs are shot at an operated studio facility in Miami, where 85 percent of the network's telenovelas were recorded during 2011. The average hourly primetime drama costs $70K to produce.

Telemundo (Spanish pronunciation: [teleˈmundo] ; formerly NetSpan) is an American Spanish-language terrestrial television network owned by NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, a division of NBCUniversal, which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast. It provides content nationally with programming syndicated worldwide to more than 100 countries in over 35 languages.
The network was founded in 1984 as NetSpan before being renamed Telemundo in 1987 after the branding used on WKAQ-TV, its owned-and-operated station in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1997, Liberty Media and Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired controlling interest in Telemundo. NBC then purchased Telemundo in 2001.
The channel broadcasts programs and original content aimed at Latin American audiences in the United States and worldwide, consisting of telenovelas, sports, reality television, news programming and films—either imported or Spanish-dubbed. In addition, Telemundo operates Universo, a separate channel directed towards young Hispanic audiences; Telemundo Digital Media, which distributes original programming content across mass media, the Telemundo and Universo websites; Puerto Rico free-to-air station WKAQ-TV; and international distribution arm Telemundo Internacional.
Telemundo is headquartered in Miami and operates a studio and productions facility in the Miami suburb of Doral, Florida, and has 1,900 employees worldwide. The majority of Telemundo's programs are shot at an operated studio facility in Miami, where 85 percent of the network's telenovelas were recorded during 2011. The average hourly primetime drama costs $70K to produce.

## Key Insights from Related Tasks
The following are insights gathered during the execution of similar tasks. You may refer to them during your task execution to improve problem-solving accuracy.

1. When evaluating the relevance of information, consider the source and context of the information. In this case, the information about 20th Century Fox should have been cross-referenced with Fox 2000 Pictures to determine if there was any connection to the release of Soul Food.
2. When searching for specific information about a person's lifestyle or beliefs, try to use a combination of general and specific keywords. For example, instead of just searching for "vegan," try "vegan diet," "lifestyle," and "public statements" together.
3. When a direct search for the required information fails, broaden your search to include related topics or fields that might provide indirect evidence. For example, if searching for a person's dietary habits fails, look for interviews, articles, or social media posts where they might have discussed their lifestyle or beliefs.
4. When verifying claims about historical events or specific seasons, cross-reference with known historical data to avoid misinterpretation, because the specific season number must be cross-referenced with established historical records.
5. Eliminate unnecessary thinking, because focusing on core objectives improves execution efficiency.

Use the above examples and insights as a foundation, and now work on the following task:
Claim: Damon Albarn's debut album was released in 2011.

>

2025-04-19 20:05:55 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Damon Albarn and find information about his debut album and its release date.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:06:00 - Act 2: Search[Damon Albarn]
Obs 2: Damon Albarn (, AWL-barn; born 23 March 1968) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is best known as the frontman and main vocalist of the rock band Blur and the co-creator and primary musical contributor of the virtual band Gorillaz.
Raised in Leytonstone, East London, and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended the Stanway School, where he met Graham Coxon, with whom he would later form Blur in 1988. They released their debut album Leisure in 1991.  After spending long periods touring the US, Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result was the Blur albums Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three received critical acclaim, while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a Britpop chart rivalry with Oasis. Chart-topping albums such as Blur (1997), 13 (1999) and Think Tank (2003) incorporated influences from lo-fi, art rock, electronic and world music. These were followed by The Magic Whip (2015), Blur's first studio album in 12 years, and The Ballad of Darren in 2023.
Albarn formed the virtual band Gorillaz in 1998 with the comic book artist Jamie Hewlett. Drawing influences from electronic, hip-hop and world music, Gorillaz released their self-titled debut album in 2001 to worldwide success, spawning numerous successful follow-ups and continuing to release albums and tour into the 2020s.  Albarn remains the group's only consistent musical contributor. His other notable projects have included the supergroups The Good, the Bad & the Queen and Rocket Juice & the Moon. He co-founded the non-profit musical organisation Africa Express and has composed film soundtracks. Albarn also scored the stage productions Monkey: Journey to the West (2008), Dr Dee (2012) and Wonder.land (2016). His debut solo album, Everyday Robots, was released in 2014, followed by The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows in 2021.
In 2008, The Daily Telegraph named Albarn the 18th-most powerful person in British culture. In 2016, Albarn received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to music. In 2020, Albarn was granted Icelandic citizenship.
2025-04-19 20:06:03 - Act 3: Thought 2: The passage mentions that Damon Albarn released his debut solo album, Everyday Robots, in 2014. This suggests that his debut album as a solo artist was not released in 2011.

Claim: There is a capital called Mogadishu.

>

2025-04-19 20:06:20 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Mogadishu to find information about its status as a capital.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:06:25 - Act 2: Search[Mogadishu]
Obs 2: Mogadishu, locally known as Xamar or Hamar, is the capital and most populous city of Somalia. The city has served as an important port connecting traders across the Indian Ocean for millennia and has an estimated urban population of 2,610,483.
Mogadishu is located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean, which, unlike other Somali regions, is considered a municipality rather than a maamul goboleed (federal state).
Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade and eventually came under the Ajuran Sultanate in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry. In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate. In the 19th century, it came under the Sultanate of the Geledi's sphere of influence.
In 1894, the Somali chief signed a treaty of peace, friendship, and protection with Filonardi of the Commercial Company of Benadir. The onset of Italian colonial rule occurred in stages, with treaties signed in the 1880s followed by economic engagement between Somali clans and the Commercial Company of Benadir, and then direct governance by the Italian Empire after 1906, British Military Administration of Somalia after World War II and the Trust Territory of Somaliland administered by Italy in the 1950s.
This was followed by independence in 1960, the Somali Democratic Republic era during Siad Barre's presidency (1969–1991). The three-decade long Somali Civil War afterwards devastated the city. As of the late 2010s and 2020s, a period of major reconstruction commenced.

## Key Insights from Related Tasks
The following are insights gathered during the execution of similar tasks. You may refer to them during your task execution to improve problem-solving accuracy.

1. When evaluating the relevance of information, consider the source and context of the information. In this case, the information about 20th Century Fox should have been cross-referenced with Fox 2000 Pictures to determine if there was any connection to the release of Soul Food.
2. When searching for specific information about a person's lifestyle or beliefs, try to use a combination of general and specific keywords. For example, instead of just searching for "vegan," try "vegan diet," "lifestyle," and "public statements" together.
3. When a direct search for the required information fails, broaden your search to include related topics or fields that might provide indirect evidence. For example, if searching for a person's dietary habits fails, look for interviews, articles, or social media posts where they might have discussed their lifestyle or beliefs.
4. When verifying claims about historical events or specific seasons, cross-reference with known historical data to avoid misinterpretation, because the specific season number must be cross-referenced with established historical records.
5. Eliminate unnecessary thinking, because focusing on core objectives improves execution efficiency.

3. When dealing with specific historical events or seasons, consult official league records or reputable historical sources to ensure accuracy, because relying solely on general information can lead to misinterpretation.
4. Verify information from multiple sources, because cross-referencing enhances accuracy.
5. When evaluating the relevance of information, consider the source and context of the information, and cross-reference with related entities to ensure comprehensive understanding, because this approach helps in avoiding misinformation and ensures a thorough analysis.

2025-04-19 20:09:42 - Act 7: Thought 4: It seems that the search for "Shooter (2007 film)" is not yielding any results. I should try to find more information about the movie by searching for the main actor or director associated with the film.
Obs 7: OK.
2025-04-19 20:09:44 - Act 8: Thought 4: Since searching for "Shooter (2007 film)" directly is not yielding results, I should look for information about the main actor or director associated with the film. The main actor in the 2007 film "Shooter" is Mark Wahlberg.
Obs 8: OK.

He is also known for his recurring roles in Wiseguy (1989), Kojak (2005), Rizzoli & Isles (2010–2014) and Godfather of Harlem (2019–2021).
2025-04-19 20:09:58 - Act 12: Thought 6: Since searching for Chazz Palminteri did not provide information about the movie "Shooter," I should try to find more information about the film by searching for the plot summary or main characters associated with the movie.
Obs 12: OK.
2025-04-19 20:10:01 - Act 13: Thought 7: Since the previous searches did not yield any results, I should try to find a plot summary or main characters associated with the movie "Shooter" by searching for the film directly again, but this time focusing on the plot and main characters.
Obs 13: OK.
2025-04-19 20:10:03 - Act 14: Search[Shooter (2007 film)]

Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 20:10:48 - Act 4: Search[House (TV series)]
Obs 4: House (also called House, M.D.) is an American medical drama television series created by David Shore for Fox. It ran for eight seasons from November 16, 2004, to May 21, 2012. It features the life of Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an unconventional, misanthropic, cynical medical genius who, despite his dependence on pain medication, successfully leads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton–Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey.
House often clashes with his fellow physicians, including his own diagnostic team, because many of his hypotheses about patients' illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights. His flouting of hospital rules and procedures frequently leads him into conflict with his boss, hospital administrator and Dean of Medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). His only true friend is Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), head of the Department of Oncology.
During the first three seasons, House's diagnostic team consists of Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps). At the end of the third season, this team disbands. Rejoined by Foreman, House gradually selects three new team members: Dr. Remy "Thirteen" Hadley (Olivia Wilde), Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), and Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn). Chase and Cameron continue to appear occasionally in different roles at the hospital. Kutner dies late in season five; early in season six, Cameron departs the hospital, and Chase returns to the diagnostic team. Thirteen takes a leave of absence for most of season seven, and her position is filled by medical student Martha M. Masters (Amber Tamblyn). Cuddy and Masters depart before season eight; Foreman becomes the new Dean of Medicine, while Dr. Jessica Adams (Odette Annable) and Dr. Chi Park (Charlyne Yi) join House's team.
The premise of House originated with Paul Attanasio, while Shore was responsible for conceiving the titular character. The series' executive producers included Shore, Attanasio, Attanasio's business partner Katie Jacobs, and film director Bryan Singer. It was filmed largely in a neighborhood and business district in Los Angeles County's Westside called Century City. The series was produced by Attanasio and Jacobs' Heel and Toe Films, Shore's Shore Z Productions, Singer's Bad Hat Harry Productions, and Universal Television.
House was among the top 10 series in the United States from its second through fourth seasons. Distributed to 71 countries, it was the most-watched TV program in the world in 2008. It received numerous awards, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, a Peabody Award, and nine People's Choice Awards. On February 8, 2012, Fox announced that the eighth season, then in progress, would be its last. The series finale aired on May 21, 2012, following an hour-long retrospective.
2025-04-19 20:10:49 - Act 5: Thought 3: The passage clearly states that House is an American medical drama television series. Therefore, the claim that "House is a sitcom" is false.

You successfully finished this task.
    

### Key steps:

Verify the Claim: Confirm that Mogadishu is indeed the capital based on the found information.
Support the Claim: Conclude that the claim is true.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Mogadishu to find information about its status as a capital.
OK.
> Search[Mogadishu]
Mogadishu, locally known as Xamar or Hamar, is the capital and most populous city of Somalia. The city has served as an important port connecting traders across the Indian Ocean for millennia and has an estimated urban population of 2,610,483.
Mogadishu is located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean, which, unlike other Somali regions, is considered a municipality rather than a maamul goboleed (federal state).
Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade and eventually came under the Ajuran Sultanate in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry. In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate. In the 19th century, it came under the Sultanate of the Geledi's sphere of influence.
In 1894, the Somali chief signed a treaty of peace, friendship, and protection with Filonardi of the Commercial Company of Benadir. The onset of Italian colonial rule occurred in stages, with treaties signed in the 1880s followed by economic engagement between Somali clans and the Commercial Company of Benadir, and then direct governance by the Italian Empire after 1906, British Military Administration of Somalia after World War II and the Trust Territory of Somaliland administered by Italy in the 1950s.
This was followed by independence in 1960, the Somali Democratic Republic era during Siad Barre's presidency (1969–1991). The three-decade long Somali Civil War afterwards devastated the city. As of the late 2010s and 2020s, a period of major reconstruction commenced.

Claim: The Cretaceous ended.

2025-04-19 20:11:11 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about the end of the Cretaceous period.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:11:16 - Act 2: Search[Cretaceous]
Obs 2: The Cretaceous (IPA:  krih-TAY-shəss) is a geological period that lasted from about 143.1 to 66 million years ago (Mya). It is the third and final period of the Mesozoic Era, as well as the longest. At around 77.1 million years, it is the ninth and longest geological period of the entire Phanerozoic. The name is derived from the Latin creta, 'chalk', which is abundant in the latter half of the period. It is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation Kreide.
The Cretaceous was a period with a relatively warm climate, resulting in high eustatic sea levels that created numerous shallow inland seas. These oceans and seas were populated with now-extinct marine reptiles, ammonites, and rudists, while dinosaurs continued to dominate on land. The world was largely ice-free, although there is some evidence of brief periods of glaciation during the cooler first half, and forests extended to the poles.
Many of the dominant taxonomic groups present in modern times can be ultimately traced back to origins in the Cretaceous. During this time, new groups of mammals and birds appeared, including the earliest relatives of placentals & marsupials (Eutheria and Metatheria respectively), with the earliest crown group birds appearing towards to the end of the Cretaceous. Teleost fish, the most diverse group of modern vertebrates continued to diversify during the Cretaceous with the appearance of their most diverse subgroup Acanthomorpha during this period. During the Early Cretaceous, flowering plants appeared and began to rapidly diversify, becoming the dominant group of plants across the Earth by the end of the Cretaceous, coincident with the decline and extinction of previously widespread gymnosperm groups.
The Cretaceous (along with the Mesozoic) ended with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a large mass extinction in which many groups, including non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and large marine reptiles, died out, widely thought to have been caused by the impact of a large asteroid that formed the Chicxulub crater in the Gulf of Mexico. The end of the Cretaceous is defined by the abrupt Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), a geologic signature associated with the mass extinction that lies between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras.

Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 20:13:34 - Act 4: Search[Tate–LaBianca murders]
Obs 4: The Tate–LaBianca murders were a series of murders perpetrated by members of the Manson Family during August 9–10, 1969, in Los Angeles, California, United States, under the direction of Tex Watson and Charles Manson. The perpetrators killed five people on the night of August 8–9: pregnant actress Sharon Tate and her companions Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger and Wojciech Frykowski, along with Steven Parent. The following evening, the Family murdered supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, at their home in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles.
On the night of August 8–9, four members of the Family – Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Linda Kasabian – drove from Spahn Ranch to 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, the home Tate shared with her husband, film director Roman Polanski. The group murdered Tate (who was 8½ months pregnant), and guests Sebring, a celebrity hairdresser; Folger, heiress to the Folgers coffee fortune; her boyfriend Frykowski, an aspiring screenwriter; and Parent, an 18-year-old visiting the guest house caretaker. Polanski was not home as he was working on a film in Europe. Manson was a cult leader and wannabe musician who had tried to get a contract with record producer Terry Melcher, who had previously rented the house.
The following night, the four participants in the Cielo Drive killings, in addition to Manson, Leslie Van Houten and Steve "Clem" Grogan, committed two more murders. Manson had allegedly said he would show them how to do it. Linda Kasabian drove the group to 3301 Waverly Drive.: 22–25, 42–48  Manson left with Atkins, Grogan and Kasabian in the car and told the others to hitchhike back to the ranch. Watson, Krenwinkel and Van Houten killed the couple in the early morning hours of August 10.

Obs 7: OK.
2025-04-19 20:13:45 - Act 8: Search[Charles Manson legal case]
Obs 8: Charles Milles Manson (né Maddox; November 12, 1934 – November 19, 2017) was an American criminal, cult leader, and musician who led the Manson Family, a cult based in California in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some cult members committed a series of at least nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969. In 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, including the film actress Sharon Tate. The prosecution contended that, while Manson never directly ordered the murders, his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy.
Before the murders, Manson had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions. While gathering his cult following, he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry, chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, who introduced Manson to record producer Terry Melcher. In 1968, the Beach Boys recorded Manson's song "Cease to Exist", renamed "Never Learn Not to Love" as a single B-side, but Manson was uncredited. Afterward, he attempted to secure a record contract through Melcher, but was unsuccessful.
Manson would often talk about the Beatles, including their eponymous 1968 album. According to Los Angeles County District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi, Manson felt guided by his interpretation of the Beatles' lyrics and adopted the term "Helter Skelter" to describe an impending apocalyptic race war. During his trial, Bugliosi argued that Manson had intended to start a race war, although Manson and others disputed this. Contemporary interviews and trial witness testimony insisted that the Tate–LaBianca murders were copycat crimes intended to exonerate Manson's friend Bobby Beausoleil. Manson himself denied having ordered any murders. Nevertheless, he served his time in prison and died from complications from colon cancer in 2017.
2025-04-19 20:13:48 - Act 9: Thought 5: The information provided in the last search indicates that Charles Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, including Sharon Tate. This suggests that he has been proven guilty, not innocent, of the crimes he was charged with. Therefore, the claim that Charles Manson has been proven innocent of all crimes is false.
Obs 9: OK.

The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. His meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. Before his 22nd birthday, he had set many records for top-scoring, some of which still stand, and became Australia's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression. This hero status grew and continued through the Second World War.
During a 20-year playing career, Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him, in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull, "worth three batsmen to Australia". A controversial set of tactics, known as Bodyline, was specially devised by the England team to curb his scoring. As a captain and administrator, Bradman was committed to attacking, entertaining cricket; he drew spectators in record numbers. He hated the constant adulation, however, and it affected how he dealt with others. The focus of attention on Bradman's individual performances strained relationships with some teammates, administrators and journalists, who thought him aloof and wary. Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War, he made a dramatic comeback, captaining an Australian team known as "The Invincibles" on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England.
A complex and highly driven man, not given to close personal relationships, Bradman retained a pre-eminent position in the game by acting as an administrator, selector and writer for three decades following his retirement. Even after he became reclusive in his declining years, Bradman's opinion was highly sought, and his status as a national icon was still recognised. Almost fifty years after his retirement as a Test player, in 1997, Prime Minister John Howard called him the "greatest living Australian". Bradman's image has appeared on postage stamps and coins, and a museum dedicated to his life was opened while he was still living. On the centenary of his birth, 27 August 2008, the Royal Australian Mint issued a $5 commemorative gold coin with Bradman's image. In 2009, he was inducted posthumously as an inaugural member into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.
2025-04-19 20:15:14 - Act 7: Thought 4: The information found indicates that Don Bradman was a cricketer, not a soccer player. There is no mention of him retiring from soccer. Therefore, the claim that Don Bradman retired from soccer is false.

1. When verifying claims about historical events or specific seasons, cross-reference with known historical data to avoid misinterpretation, because the specific season number must be cross-referenced with established historical records and the claim should be supported by multiple reliable sources.
2. When dealing with specific historical events or seasons, consult official league records or reputable historical sources to ensure accuracy, because relying solely on general information can lead to misinterpretation.
3. When verifying claims, cross-reference the information with multiple reliable sources to ensure accuracy and avoid making assumptions based on a single search result, because relying on a single source can lead to misinformation.
4. When searching for information, use specific keywords to narrow down the search and increase the relevance of the results, because broad searches can yield irrelevant information.
5. When searching for information, use multiple relevant keywords and cross-reference with official sources to ensure comprehensive and accurate results, because a single keyword may not yield the necessary information and official sources provide reliable data.

Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 20:16:11 - Act 4: Search[Rage Against the Machine]
Obs 4: Rage Against the Machine (often abbreviated as RATM or shortened to Rage) was an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1991. It consisted of vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, guitarist Tom Morello, and drummer Brad Wilk. They melded  heavy metal and rap music, punk rock and funk with anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist, and revolutionary lyrics. As of 2010, they had sold over 16 million records worldwide. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.
Rage Against the Machine released their self-titled debut album in 1992 to acclaim; in 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number 368 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. They achieved commercial success following their performances at the 1993 Lollapalooza festival. Their next albums, Evil Empire (1996) and The Battle of Los Angeles (1999), topped the Billboard 200 chart. Rage Against the Machine became a popular and influential band, and influenced the nu metal genre which came to prominence during the late 1990s and early 2000s. They were also ranked No. 33 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.
In 2000, Rage Against the Machine released the cover album Renegades and disbanded after growing creative differences. After pursuing other projects for several years, they reunited to perform at Coachella in 2007. Over the next four years, the band played live venues and festivals around the world before going on hiatus in 2011. In 2019, Rage Against the Machine announced a world tour that was delayed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was ultimately cut short after de la Rocha suffered a leg injury. Wilk confirmed in 2024 that the band had disbanded for the third time.
2025-04-19 20:16:14 - Act 5: Thought 3: The observation mentions that Brad Wilk was a member of Rage Against the Machine, but it does not specify when he joined or if he co-founded the band. I need to find more specific information about the band's formation and the roles of its members.

The observation states that Rage Against the Machine was formed in 1991, and Brad Wilk was a member of the band. However, it does not explicitly mention if he co-founded the band or his role in the formation.
Obs 7: OK.
2025-04-19 20:16:22 - Act 8: Thought 5: Given that the information provided does not explicitly state that Brad Wilk co-founded Rage Against the Machine in 1962, and the band was actually formed in 1991, the claim is incorrect.

Telemundo (Spanish pronunciation: [teleˈmundo] ; formerly NetSpan) is an American Spanish-language terrestrial television network owned by NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, a division of NBCUniversal, which in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast. It provides content nationally with programming syndicated worldwide to more than 100 countries in over 35 languages.
The network was founded in 1984 as NetSpan before being renamed Telemundo in 1987 after the branding used on WKAQ-TV, its owned-and-operated station in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1997, Liberty Media and Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired controlling interest in Telemundo. NBC then purchased Telemundo in 2001.
The channel broadcasts programs and original content aimed at Latin American audiences in the United States and worldwide, consisting of telenovelas, sports, reality television, news programming and films—either imported or Spanish-dubbed. In addition, Telemundo operates Universo, a separate channel directed towards young Hispanic audiences; Telemundo Digital Media, which distributes original programming content across mass media, the Telemundo and Universo websites; Puerto Rico free-to-air station WKAQ-TV; and international distribution arm Telemundo Internacional.
Telemundo is headquartered in Miami and operates a studio and productions facility in the Miami suburb of Doral, Florida, and has 1,900 employees worldwide. The majority of Telemundo's programs are shot at an operated studio facility in Miami, where 85 percent of the network's telenovelas were recorded during 2011. The average hourly primetime drama costs $70K to produce.

Obs 2: Annette W. E. Badland (born 26 August 1950) is a British actress known for a wide range of roles on television, radio, stage, and film.

2025-04-19 20:18:32 - Act 3: Thought 2: The information provided does not mention Annette Badland being involved in the NBA or the 2015 NBA Finals. Since the claim is about her being in the NBA Finals, I need to look up more specific information about the 2015 NBA Finals to see if any actors or actresses were involved.

However, given that Annette Badland is an actress and the NBA Finals are a professional basketball event, it is highly unlikely that she was involved. I will proceed with a more general search to confirm this.
Obs 5: OK.
2025-04-19 20:18:44 - Act 6: Search[NBA Finals 2015]
Obs 6: The 2015 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2014–15 season and the conclusion of the season's playoffs played from June 4 to 16, 2015. It was contested by the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors and the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers.
The Warriors, led by the duo of Klay Thompson and 2014–15 MVP Stephen Curry, won the opening game at home in overtime. However, despite the loss of an injured Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving during most of the series, the Cavaliers, led by LeBron James (in his fifth consecutive Finals appearance, and sixth overall) managed to take a 2–1 series lead before the Warriors won the last three for their first title since 1975.
Golden State's Andre Iguodala was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP). Andre Iguodala received 7 of the 11 votes, with LeBron James receiving the other 4. LeBron James also became the first player in NBA Finals history to lead both teams in points, rebounds, and assists for the entire series, after averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game. This is the last NBA Finals to be played on a Thursday–Sunday–Tuesday scheme, with the schedule format being changed beginning the following Finals.

Obs 7: OK.
2025-04-19 20:19:28 - Act 8: Search[Shaun of the Dead]
Obs 8: Shaun of the Dead is a 2004 zombie comedy film directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg. Pegg stars as Shaun, a downtrodden London salesman who is caught alongside his loved ones in a zombie apocalypse. It also stars Nick Frost in his film debut, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, and Penelope Wilton. It is the first film in Wright and Pegg's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, followed by Hot Fuzz (2007) and The World's End (2013).
Shaun of the Dead was inspired by ideas Pegg and Wright used for their 1999-2001 television sitcom Spaced, particularly an episode in which Pegg's character hallucinates a zombie invasion. The film references the Night of the Living Dead films by George A. Romero. Principal photography took place across London and at Ealing Studios for nine weeks between May and June 2003.
Shaun of the Dead premiered in London on 29 March 2004, before it was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2004 and in the United States on 24 September. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing $38.7 million worldwide on a budget of $6.1 million and receiving two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards. It was ranked third on the Channel 4 list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films and quickly acquired a cult following. In film studies, it is seen as a product of post-9/11 anxiety and a model for transnational comedy, while the zombie outbreak as depicted in the film has been used as a modelling example for disease control.
2025-04-19 20:19:30 - Act 9: Thought 5: Since the information about "Shaun of the Dead" confirms that Edgar Wright directed this film, it supports the claim that Edgar Wright is a person, specifically a film director.

Damon Albarn (, AWL-barn; born 23 March 1968) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is best known as the frontman and main vocalist of the rock band Blur and the co-creator and primary musical contributor of the virtual band Gorillaz.
Raised in Leytonstone, East London, and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended the Stanway School, where he met Graham Coxon, with whom he would later form Blur in 1988. They released their debut album Leisure in 1991.  After spending long periods touring the US, Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result was the Blur albums Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three received critical acclaim, while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a Britpop chart rivalry with Oasis. Chart-topping albums such as Blur (1997), 13 (1999) and Think Tank (2003) incorporated influences from lo-fi, art rock, electronic and world music. These were followed by The Magic Whip (2015), Blur's first studio album in 12 years, and The Ballad of Darren in 2023.
Albarn formed the virtual band Gorillaz in 1998 with the comic book artist Jamie Hewlett. Drawing influences from electronic, hip-hop and world music, Gorillaz released their self-titled debut album in 2001 to worldwide success, spawning numerous successful follow-ups and continuing to release albums and tour into the 2020s.  Albarn remains the group's only consistent musical contributor. His other notable projects have included the supergroups The Good, the Bad & the Queen and Rocket Juice & the Moon. He co-founded the non-profit musical organisation Africa Express and has composed film soundtracks. Albarn also scored the stage productions Monkey: Journey to the West (2008), Dr Dee (2012) and Wonder.land (2016). His debut solo album, Everyday Robots, was released in 2014, followed by The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows in 2021.
In 2008, The Daily Telegraph named Albarn the 18th-most powerful person in British culture. In 2016, Albarn received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to music. In 2020, Albarn was granted Icelandic citizenship.

2025-04-19 20:22:15 - Act 3: Thought 2: Since the search did not return the exact entity, I should look at the similar entities provided to find relevant information about Janet Leigh. The most relevant entity is "Psycho (1960 film)" as it is one of her most famous works, and the film's screenplay might provide information about her writing abilities or lack thereof.
Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 20:22:20 - Act 4: Search[Psycho (1960 film)]
Obs 4: Psycho is a 1998 American psychological horror film produced and directed by Gus Van Sant, and starring Vince Vaughn, Julianne Moore, Viggo Mortensen, William H. Macy, and Anne Heche. It is a modern remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film of the same name, in which an embezzler arrives at an old motel run by a mysterious man named Norman Bates; both films are adapted from Robert Bloch's 1959 novel.
Though filmed in color and set in 1998, the film is closer to a shot-for-shot retelling than most remakes, often copying Hitchcock's camera movements and editing, including the original script by Joseph Stefano (and uncredited writer Alma Reville) mostly being carried over. Bernard Herrmann's musical score is reused as well, though with a new arrangement by Danny Elfman and Steve Bartek, recorded in stereo. Some changes are introduced to account for advances in technology since the original film and to make the content more explicit. The film's murder sequences are also intercut with surreal images.
Psycho was a commercial failure and received polarized reviews from critics who criticized the similarities to the original film. It won the Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Remake and Worst Director, and was nominated for Worst Actress (Heche). However, it earned two Saturn Award nominations for Best Actress (Heche) and Best Writing (Stefano).
2025-04-19 20:22:23 - Act 5: Thought 3: The information provided does not mention Janet Leigh's writing abilities. It only discusses the remake of the 1960 film "Psycho" and does not provide any details about Janet Leigh's writing. I need to find more information about Janet Leigh herself to determine if she was capable of writing.

2025-04-19 20:22:28 - Act 7: Thought 4: Since the search for Janet Leigh still did not return the exact entity, I should look at the similar entities provided to find more relevant information. The most relevant entity is "List of Janet Leigh performances" as it might provide information about her roles and writing abilities.
Obs 7: OK.
2025-04-19 20:22:33 - Act 8: Search[List of Janet Leigh performances]
Obs 8: Janet Leigh was an American actress of film, television, stage, and radio, whose career spanned over five decades. Discovered by actress Norma Shearer, Leigh began her career appearing in several popular films for MGM which spanned a wide variety of genres, including Act of Violence (1948), Little Women (1949), Angels in the Outfield (1951), Scaramouche (1952), The Naked Spur (1953), and Living It Up (1954).
In the latter part of the 1950s, Leigh had supporting roles in Safari (1956), and Orson Welles's film noir Touch of Evil (1958). She went on to gain lasting recognition for her portrayal of the doomed Marion Crane in Alfred Hitchcock's horror film Psycho (1960), which earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.
In 1962, she starred in the thriller The Manchurian Candidate, before deciding to scale back her career. Leigh continued to appear in films intermittently throughout the 1960s, with roles in Bye Bye Birdie (1963) and Harper (1966). She began to appear in television frequently in the 1970s, and had roles in such films as Night of the Lepus (1972) and Boardwalk (1979). In 1975, she made her Broadway debut in a production of Murder Among Friends. Leigh subsequently starred in two horror films with her daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis: John Carpenter's The Fog (1980) and Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998).
Her last film role was in the comedy Bad Girls from Valley High, filmed in 2000 and released posthumously. Leigh died in 2004 of vasculitis, aged 77.
2025-04-19 20:22:35 - Act 9: Thought 5: The information provided in the "List of Janet Leigh performances" does not mention her writing abilities or lack thereof.

Obs 9: OK.
2025-04-19 20:22:39 - Act 10: Thought 6: Since the information about Janet Leigh's performances does not mention her writing abilities, I should look for any additional sources that might provide information about her writing. Given that she was an actress, it is less likely that she was known for writing, but I should still check if there is any mention of her writing in her biography or other sources.
Obs 10: OK.
2025-04-19 20:22:43 - Act 11: Thought 7: Since the previous searches did not provide information about Janet Leigh's writing abilities, I should consider the possibility that she might have written screenplays or books.

Obs 11: OK.
2025-04-19 20:22:46 - Act 12: Thought 8: Given that the previous searches did not provide information about Janet Leigh's writing abilities, I should consider the possibility that she might have written screenplays or books.

Obs 12: OK.
2025-04-19 20:22:50 - Act 13: Thought 9: Since the searches did not provide any information about Janet Leigh's writing abilities, and given her prominence as an actress, it is highly unlikely that she was known for writing. The claim that Janet Leigh was incapable of writing seems to be based on a misunderstanding or lack of information. However, without any direct evidence, I cannot definitively support or refute the claim.
Obs 13: OK.
2025-04-19 20:22:55 - Act 14: Thought 10: Given the information gathered, there is no direct evidence to support or refute the claim that Janet Leigh was incapable of writing.

Claim: Simón Bolívar is only known as Simón Bolívar.

Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:23:26 - Act 2: Search[Simón Bolívar]
Obs 2: Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar Palacios Ponte y Blanco (24 July 1783 – 17 December 1830) was a Venezuelan statesman and military officer who led what are currently the countries of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, and Bolivia to independence from the Spanish Empire. He is known colloquially as El Libertador, or the Liberator of America.
Simón Bolívar was born in Caracas in the Captaincy General of Venezuela into a wealthy family of American-born Spaniards (criollo) but lost both parents as a child. Bolívar was educated abroad and lived in Spain, as was common for men of upper-class families in his day. While living in Madrid from 1800 to 1802, he was introduced to Enlightenment philosophy and married María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alaysa, who died in Venezuela from yellow fever in 1803. From 1803 to 1805, Bolívar embarked on a Grand Tour that ended in Rome, where he swore to end the Spanish rule in the Americas. In 1807, Bolívar returned to Venezuela and promoted Venezuelan independence to other wealthy creoles. When the Spanish authority in the Americas weakened due to Napoleon's Peninsular War, Bolívar became a zealous combatant and politician in the Spanish-American wars of independence.
Bolívar began his military career in 1810 as a militia officer in the Venezuelan War of Independence, fighting Royalist forces for the first and second Venezuelan republics and the United Provinces of New Granada. After Spanish forces subdued New Granada in 1815, Bolívar was forced into exile on Jamaica. In Haiti, Bolívar met and befriended Haitian revolutionary leader Alexandre Pétion. After promising to abolish slavery in Spanish America, Bolívar received military support from Pétion and returned to Venezuela. He established a third republic in 1817 and then crossed the Andes to liberate New Granada in 1819. Bolívar and his allies defeated the Spanish in New Granada in 1819, Venezuela and Panama in 1821, Ecuador in 1822, Peru in 1824, and Bolivia in 1825. Venezuela, New Granada, Ecuador, and Panama were merged into the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia), with Bolívar as president there and in Peru and Bolivia.
In his final years, Bolívar became increasingly disillusioned with the South American republics, and distanced from them because of his centralist ideology. He was successively removed from his offices until he resigned the presidency of Colombia and died of tuberculosis in 1830. His legacy is diverse and far-reaching within Latin America and beyond. He is regarded as a hero and national and cultural icon throughout Latin America; the nations of Bolivia and Venezuela (as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) are named after him, and he has been memorialized all over the world in the form of public art or street names and in popular culture.
2025-04-19 20:23:29 - Act 3: Thought 2: The information found indicates that Simón Bolívar is known by his full name, Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar Palacios Ponte y Blanco, and he is a historical figure who led several countries to independence from the Spanish Empire. There is no indication that he is only known as Simón Bolívar.

## Your Own Past Successes (Execution Patterns)
Here are examples of successful execution processes you've previously used on similar tasks.  
Pay special attention to the step-by-step procedures and strategies, especially when encountering obstacles:

Task 1:

### Task description:   
Claim: There is a capital called Mogadishu.
- Environment feedback
You successfully finished this task.
    

### Key steps:
Search for Mogadishu: Look up information about Mogadishu.
Find Information: Locate the information that Mogadishu is the capital of Somalia.
Verify the Claim: Confirm that Mogadishu is indeed the capital based on the found information.
Support the Claim: Conclude that the claim is true.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Mogadishu to find information about its status as a capital.
OK.
> Search[Mogadishu]
Mogadishu, locally known as Xamar or Hamar, is the capital and most populous city of Somalia. The city has served as an important port connecting traders across the Indian Ocean for millennia and has an estimated urban population of 2,610,483.
Mogadishu is located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean, which, unlike other Somali regions, is considered a municipality rather than a maamul goboleed (federal state).
Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade and eventually came under the Ajuran Sultanate in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry. In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate. In the 19th century, it came under the Sultanate of the Geledi's sphere of influence.
In 1894, the Somali chief signed a treaty of peace, friendship, and protection with Filonardi of the Commercial Company of Benadir. The onset of Italian colonial rule occurred in stages, with treaties signed in the 1880s followed by economic engagement between Somali clans and the Commercial Company of Benadir, and then direct governance by the Italian Empire after 1906, British Military Administration of Somalia after World War II and the Trust Territory of Somaliland administered by Italy in the 1950s.
This was followed by independence in 1960, the Somali Democratic Republic era during Siad Barre's presidency (1969–1991). The three-decade long Somali Civil War afterwards devastated the city. As of the late 2010s and 2020s, a period of major reconstruction commenced.
> Thought 2: The passage clearly states that Mogadishu is the capital of Somalia. Therefore, the claim is true.
OK.
> Finish[SUPPORTS]
Answer is CORRECT

Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:23:56 - Act 2: Search[Bermuda Triangle]
Obs 2: The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a loosely defined region in the North Atlantic Ocean, roughly bounded by Florida, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico. Since the mid-20th century, it has been the focus of an urban legend suggesting that many aircraft, ships, and people have disappeared there under mysterious circumstances. However, extensive investigations by reputable sources, including the U.S. government and scientific organizations, have found no evidence of unusual activity, attributing reported incidents to natural phenomena, human error, and misinterpretation.
2025-04-19 20:23:59 - Act 3: Thought 2: The Bermuda Triangle is located in the North Atlantic Ocean, specifically between Florida, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico. This is far from the Himalayas, which are in the southern part of Asia, primarily in India, Nepal, and Pakistan. Therefore, the claim is false.

Analyze Information: Determine that Brad Wilk was a member of Rage Against the Machine but not explicitly mentioned as a co-founder.
Conclude: Realize the claim that Brad Wilk helped co-found Rage in 1962 is incorrect based on the available information.

> Thought 2: Since the search for "Brad Wilk" did not yield results, I should look for information about "Rage Against the Machine" and see if Brad Wilk is mentioned as a co-founder in 1962.
OK.
> Search[Rage Against the Machine]
Rage Against the Machine (often abbreviated as RATM or shortened to Rage) was an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1991. It consisted of vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, guitarist Tom Morello, and drummer Brad Wilk. They melded  heavy metal and rap music, punk rock and funk with anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist, and revolutionary lyrics. As of 2010, they had sold over 16 million records worldwide. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.
Rage Against the Machine released their self-titled debut album in 1992 to acclaim; in 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number 368 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. They achieved commercial success following their performances at the 1993 Lollapalooza festival. Their next albums, Evil Empire (1996) and The Battle of Los Angeles (1999), topped the Billboard 200 chart. Rage Against the Machine became a popular and influential band, and influenced the nu metal genre which came to prominence during the late 1990s and early 2000s. They were also ranked No. 33 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.
In 2000, Rage Against the Machine released the cover album Renegades and disbanded after growing creative differences. After pursuing other projects for several years, they reunited to perform at Coachella in 2007. Over the next four years, the band played live venues and festivals around the world before going on hiatus in 2011. In 2019, Rage Against the Machine announced a world tour that was delayed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was ultimately cut short after de la Rocha suffered a leg injury. Wilk confirmed in 2024 that the band had disbanded for the third time.

Claim: Colin Kaepernick became a starter during the 49ers 63rd season in the Republican Party.

>

2025-04-19 20:24:17 - Act 1: Thought 1: I need to verify if Colin Kaepernick became a starter during the 49ers 63rd season and if there is any connection to the Republican Party.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:24:21 - Act 2: Search[Colin Kaepernick]
Obs 2: Colin Rand Kaepernick ( KAP-ər-nik; born November 3, 1987) is an American civil rights activist and former professional football quarterback. He played six seasons for the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL). In 2016, he gained national attention for kneeling during the national anthem at the start of NFL games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the United States.
Kaepernick played college football for the Nevada Wolf Pack, where he was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Offensive Player of the Year twice and became the only player in NCAA Division I history to amass 10,000 passing yards and 4,000 rushing yards in a career. After graduating, he was selected by the 49ers in the second round of the 2011 NFL draft. Kaepernick began his professional football career as a backup quarterback to Alex Smith, and became the 49ers' starter in the middle of the 2012 season after Smith suffered a concussion. He then remained the team's starting quarterback for the rest of the season, leading the team to their first Super Bowl appearance since 1994. During the 2013 season, his first full season as a starter, Kaepernick helped the 49ers reach the NFC Championship Game. Over the next three seasons, Kaepernick lost and won back his starting quarterback job, with the 49ers missing the playoffs for three seasons.
In the 49ers' third preseason game in 2016, Kaepernick sat during the playing of the U.S. national anthem prior to the game, rather than stand as is customary, as a protest against racial injustice, police brutality and oppression in the country. The following week, and throughout the regular season, Kaepernick kneeled during the anthem. The protests received highly polarized reactions, with some praising his protests and others denouncing the protests. The actions resulted in a wider protest movement, which intensified in September 2017 after President Donald Trump said that NFL owners should "fire" players who protest during the national anthem. Kaepernick became a free agent after the season and remained unsigned, which numerous analysts and observers have attributed to political reasons. In November 2017, he filed a grievance against the NFL and its owners, accusing them of collusion in keeping him out of the league. In August 2018, arbitrator Stephen B. Burbank rejected the NFL's request to dismiss the case. Kaepernick withdrew the grievance in February 2019 after reaching a confidential settlement with the NFL. His protests received renewed attention in 2020 amid the George Floyd protests against police brutality and racism, but he remains unsigned by any professional football team.
2025-04-19 20:24:27 - Act 3: Thought 2: The observation mentions that Kaepernick became the 49ers' starter in the middle of the 2012 season after Alex Smith suffered a concussion. It does not mention the 49ers' 63rd season or any connection to the Republican Party. I need to find more information about the 49ers' 63rd season and any political affiliations.
Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 20:24:29 - Act 4: Lookup[49ers 63rd season]
Obs 4: No Results
2025-04-19 20:24:37 - Act 5: Thought 3: Since the direct lookup for the 49ers' 63rd season did not yield results, I should cross-reference the information about the 49ers' seasons and the Republican Party to see if there is any connection. However, the claim specifically mentions the 49ers' 63rd season, which is not a standard term used for NFL seasons. The 49ers have played in the NFL since 1946, and their seasons are typically numbered based on the year they start, not a specific season number. For example, the 2022 season would be the 77th season for the 49ers. The claim might be referring to a specific year or a particular season, but it is not clear from the information provided.
Obs 5: OK.
2025-04-19 20:24:41 - Act 6: Thought 4: Given that the claim mentions the 49ers' 63rd season, it is likely referring to a specific year. However, the information provided does not clarify which year this would be. Additionally, there is no mention of any connection to the Republican Party in the information provided. I need to find more context about the 49ers' seasons and any political affiliations, but the claim is not well-defined.
Obs 6: OK.
2025-04-19 20:24:45 - Act 7: Thought 5: Since the claim is not well-defined and there is no clear reference to the 49ers' 63rd season or any connection to the Republican Party, I need to conclude that there is not enough information to support or refute the claim. The information provided does not clarify the specific year or the connection to the Republican Party, making it impossible to determine the validity of the claim.

Set in the 1980s, primarily in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, the series centers on a number of mysteries and supernatural events occurring around the town and their impact on an ensemble of child and adult characters.

Action 2: Search[Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)]
Observation 2: "Beautiful" is a song recorded by American singer Christina Aguilera for her fourth studio album, Stripped (2002).
Thought 3: It does not mention Billboard, so I need to look up "Billboard Hot 100" to find if it reached number two on it in 2003.
Action 3: Lookup[Billboard Hot 100]
Observation 3: (Result 1 / 3) The song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, where it was certified Gold for 500,000 units shipped.

Claim: Marnie was directed by someone who was "The Master of Nothing".

>

2025-04-19 20:25:08 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for "Marnie" to find information about the film and its director. Then, I will search for "The Master of Nothing" to find out who this person is and if they directed Marnie.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:25:13 - Act 2: Search[Marnie]
Obs 2: Mardi: and a Voyage Thither is the third book by American writer Herman Melville, first published in London in 1849. Beginning as a travelogue in the vein of the author's two previous efforts, the adventure story gives way to a romance story, which in its turn gives way to a philosophical quest.
2025-04-19 20:25:15 - Act 3: Thought 2: The search result did not provide information about the film "Marnie". I need to search for "Marnie (film)" to find the correct information.
Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 20:25:19 - Act 4: Search[Marnie (film)]
Obs 4: Could not find [Marnie (film)]. Similar: ['Marnie (film)', 'When Marnie Was There (film)', 'Marnie', 'Halloweentown (film)', 'Twins (1988 film)', 'Return to Halloweentown', 'When Marnie Was There', 'Spy Cat', 'Marnie (novel)', 'The Lawnmower Man (film)']
2025-04-19 20:25:21 - Act 5: Thought 3: Since the search for "Marnie (film)" did not yield the correct result, I will try searching for "Marnie (1964 film)" to find the correct information about the film and its director.
Obs 5: OK.
2025-04-19 20:25:26 - Act 6: Search[Marnie (1964 film)]
Obs 6: Marnie is a 1964 American psychological thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock from a screenplay by Jay Presson Allen, based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Winston Graham. The film stars Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery.
Marnie became a milestone for several reasons. It was the last time a "Hitchcock blonde" would have a central role in one of his films. It also marked the end of Hitchcock's collaborations with cinematographer Robert Burks, who died in 1968; editor George Tomasini, who died soon after Marnie's release; and composer Bernard Herrmann, who was fired during Hitchcock's next film, Torn Curtain (1966), when Hitchcock and Universal studio executives wanted a pop-and-jazz-influenced score for the film.
2025-04-19 20:25:29 - Act 7: Thought 4: From the search result, I found that Marnie (1964 film) was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Now, I need to search for "The Master of Nothing" to find out who this person is and if they directed Marnie.
Obs 7: OK.
2025-04-19 20:25:35 - Act 8: Search[The Master of Nothing]
Obs 8: The Unaware Atelier Master (勘違いの工房主～英雄パーティの元雑用係が、実は戦闘以外がSSSランクだったというよくある話～, Kanchigai no Atorie Maisutā: Eiyū Pāti no Moto Zatsuyōgakari ga, Jitsu wa Sentō Igai ga SSS Ranku Datta to Iu Yoku Aru Hanashi) is a Japanese light novel series written by Yōsuke Tokino and illustrated by Zounoze. Originally published online since August 2018, AlphaPolis has published eleven volumes of the series since March 2019. A manga adaptation illustrated by Naharu Furukawa began serialization online via AlphaPolis' manga website in December 2019 and has been collected in seven tankōbon volumes. The manga is published digitally in English through Alpha Manga. An anime television series adaptation produced by EMT Squared premiered in April 2025.
2025-04-19 20:25:38 - Act 9: Thought 5: The search result for "The Master of Nothing" did not provide any information about a person who directed Marnie. The result was about a light novel series and an anime adaptation. This suggests that "The Master of Nothing" is not the director of Marnie (1964 film).
Obs 9: OK.
2025-04-19 20:25:41 - Act 10: Thought 6: Since the search for "The Master of Nothing" did not provide any relevant information about a director of Marnie (1964 film), and we already know that Marnie (1964 film) was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, we can conclude that the claim is false.
Obs 10: OK.

Shaun of the Dead is a 2004 zombie comedy film directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg. Pegg stars as Shaun, a downtrodden London salesman who is caught alongside his loved ones in a zombie apocalypse. It also stars Nick Frost in his film debut, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, and Penelope Wilton. It is the first film in Wright and Pegg's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, followed by Hot Fuzz (2007) and The World's End (2013).
Shaun of the Dead was inspired by ideas Pegg and Wright used for their 1999-2001 television sitcom Spaced, particularly an episode in which Pegg's character hallucinates a zombie invasion. The film references the Night of the Living Dead films by George A. Romero. Principal photography took place across London and at Ealing Studios for nine weeks between May and June 2003.
Shaun of the Dead premiered in London on 29 March 2004, before it was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2004 and in the United States on 24 September. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing $38.7 million worldwide on a budget of $6.1 million and receiving two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards. It was ranked third on the Channel 4 list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films and quickly acquired a cult following. In film studies, it is seen as a product of post-9/11 anxiety and a model for transnational comedy, while the zombie outbreak as depicted in the film has been used as a modelling example for disease control.

## Your Turn: Take Action!
Use the above examples and insights as a foundation, and now work on the following task:
Claim: Advertising is a personal message.

>

2025-04-19 20:27:22 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about advertising to understand its definition and characteristics.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:27:23 - Act 2: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about advertising to understand its definition and characteristics.
Obs 2: OK.
2025-04-19 20:27:29 - Act 3: Search[Advertising]
Obs 3: Advertising is the practice and techniques employed to bring attention to a product or service. Advertising aims to present a product or service in terms of utility, advantages, and qualities of interest to consumers. It is typically used to promote a specific good or service, but there are a wide range of uses, the most common being commercial advertisement.
Commercial advertisements often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through "branding", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct-response advertising. Non-commercial entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations, and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement. Advertising may also help to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful.
In the 19th century, soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns. Thomas J. Barratt was hired by Pears to be its brand manager—the first of its kind—and in addition to creating slogans and images, he recruited West End stage actress and socialite Lillie Langtry to become the poster girl for Pears, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product. Modern advertising originated with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays, considered the founder of modern, "Madison Avenue" advertising.
Worldwide spending on advertising in 2015 amounted to an estimated US$529.43 billion. Advertising's projected distribution for 2017 was 40.4% on TV, 33.3% on digital, 9% on newspapers, 6.9% on magazines, 5.8% on outdoor, and 4.3% on radio. Internationally, the largest ("Big Five") advertising agency groups are Omnicom, WPP, Publicis, Interpublic, and Dentsu.
In Latin, advertere means "to turn towards".
2025-04-19 20:27:33 - Act 4: Thought 2: From the search results, I understand that advertising is a practice that aims to bring attention to a product or service. It often seeks to generate increased consumption through branding and can also be used for non-commercial purposes. The claim states that advertising is a personal message, but the definition provided does not specifically mention that it is a personal message. I need to look up the definition of a personal message to compare it with the definition of advertising.
Obs 4: OK.
2025-04-19 20:27:34 - Act 5: Lookup[personal message]
Obs 5: No Results
2025-04-19 20:27:43 - Act 6: Thought 3: Since the lookup for "personal message" did not return any results, I should consider the general understanding of a personal message. A personal message is typically a communication intended for a specific individual or a small group of individuals, often conveying a personal or emotional message. Given the definition of advertising as a practice to bring attention to a product or service, it is not necessarily a personal message. Advertising is generally aimed at a broader audience rather than a specific individual.
Obs 6: OK.
2025-04-19 20:27:47 - Act 7: Thought 4: Based on the definition of advertising and the general understanding of a personal message, it appears that advertising is not inherently a personal message. Advertising is more about reaching a wide audience and promoting products or services, rather than being a personal communication. Therefore, the claim that "Advertising is a personal message" does not seem to be supported by the information provided.
Obs 7: OK.

Claim: Damon Albarn's debut album was released in 2011.
- Environment feedback
You successfully finished this task.
    

### Key steps:
Search for Damon Albarn: Look up information about Damon Albarn.
Find Information: Locate details about Damon Albarn's musical career.
Identify Debut Solo Album: Determine that his debut solo album, Everyday Robots, was released in 2010.
Conclude: Conclude that the claim stating his debut album was released in 2011 is incorrect.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Damon Albarn and find information about his debut album and its release date.
OK.
> Search[Damon Albarn]
Damon Albarn (, AWL-barn; born 23 March 1968) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is best known as the frontman and main vocalist of the rock band Blur and the co-creator and primary musical contributor of the virtual band Gorillaz.
Raised in Leytonstone, East London, and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended the Stanway School, where he met Graham Coxon, with whom he would later form Blur in 1988. They released their debut album Leisure in 1991.  After spending long periods touring the US, Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result was the Blur albums Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three received critical acclaim, while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a Britpop chart rivalry with Oasis. Chart-topping albums such as Blur (1997), 13 (1999) and Think Tank (2003) incorporated influences from lo-fi, art rock, electronic and world music. These were followed by The Magic Whip (2015), Blur's first studio album in 12 years, and The Ballad of Darren in 2023.
Albarn formed the virtual band Gorillaz in 1998 with the comic book artist Jamie Hewlett. Drawing influences from electronic, hip-hop and world music, Gorillaz released their self-titled debut album in 2001 to worldwide success, spawning numerous successful follow-ups and continuing to release albums and tour into the 2020s.  Albarn remains the group's only consistent musical contributor. His other notable projects have included the supergroups The Good, the Bad & the Queen and Rocket Juice & the Moon. He co-founded the non-profit musical organisation Africa Express and has composed film soundtracks. Albarn also scored the stage productions Monkey: Journey to the West (2008), Dr Dee (2012) and Wonder.land (2016). His debut solo album, Everyday Robots, was released in 2014, followed by The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows in 2021.
In 2008, The Daily Telegraph named Albarn the 18th-most powerful person in British culture. In 2016, Albarn received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to music. In 2020, Albarn was granted Icelandic citizenship.
> Thought 2: The passage mentions that Damon Albarn released his debut solo album, Everyday Robots, in 2014. This suggests that his debut album as a solo artist was not released in 2011.
OK.

2025-04-19 20:28:08 - Act 1: Thought 1: I need to search for "Hot Right Now" and DJ Fresh to find out if the song is mistakenly attributed to him.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:28:13 - Act 2: Search[Hot Right Now]
Obs 2: "Hot Right Now" is a single by English drum and bass producer DJ Fresh featuring English singer Rita Ora, released on 13 February 2012 as the second single from his third studio album, Nextlevelism (2012), before later being included as a bonus track on Ora's debut studio album Ora (2012). 
"Hot Right Now" debuted at the top of UK Singles Chart on 19 February 2012. The Official Charts Company confirmed "Hot Right Now" as the UK's first ever drum and bass number one.
2025-04-19 20:28:17 - Act 3: Thought 2: The observation indicates that "Hot Right Now" was produced by DJ Fresh and featured Rita Ora. It was also the first drum and bass number one on the UK Singles Chart. There is no mention of it being mistakenly attributed to DJ Fresh, so I need to look up DJ Fresh to see if there are any claims about him mistakenly attributing songs to himself.
Obs 3: OK.

2025-04-19 20:28:23 - Act 5: Thought 3: Since the search for DJ Fresh did not yield any relevant information, I should look up "mistakenly attributed songs" to see if there are any claims about DJ Fresh mistakenly attributing songs to himself.

Here are examples of successful execution processes you've previously used on similar tasks.  
Pay special attention to the step-by-step procedures and strategies, especially when encountering obstacles:

Task 1:

### Task description:   
Claim: Advertising is a personal message.
- Environment feedback
You successfully finished this task.
    

### Key steps:
Search for Information: Look up the definition of advertising to understand its practice and techniques.
Understand Advertising: Advertising is a practice that aims to bring attention to a product or service, often through commercial advertisement and branding.
Consider Non-Commercial Uses: Recognize that advertising can also be used for non-commercial purposes, such as political or non-profit organizations.
Define Personal Message: Understand that a personal message is typically intended for a specific individual or small group, conveying a personal or emotional message.
Compare Definitions: Compare the definition of advertising with that of a personal message, noting that advertising is generally aimed at a broader audience.
Conclude: Conclude that advertising is not inherently a personal message, as it is more about reaching a wide audience and promoting products or services.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about advertising to understand its definition and characteristics.
OK.
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about advertising to understand its definition and characteristics.
OK.
> Search[Advertising]
Advertising is the practice and techniques employed to bring attention to a product or service. Advertising aims to present a product or service in terms of utility, advantages, and qualities of interest to consumers. It is typically used to promote a specific good or service, but there are a wide range of uses, the most common being commercial advertisement.
Commercial advertisements often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through "branding", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct-response advertising. Non-commercial entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations, and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement. Advertising may also help to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful.
In the 19th century, soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns. Thomas J. Barratt was hired by Pears to be its brand manager—the first of its kind—and in addition to creating slogans and images, he recruited West End stage actress and socialite Lillie Langtry to become the poster girl for Pears, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product. Modern advertising originated with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays, considered the founder of modern, "Madison Avenue" advertising.
Worldwide spending on advertising in 2015 amounted to an estimated US$529.43 billion. Advertising's projected distribution for 2017 was 40.4% on TV, 33.3% on digital, 9% on newspapers, 6.9% on magazines, 5.8% on outdoor, and 4.3% on radio. Internationally, the largest ("Big Five") advertising agency groups are Omnicom, WPP, Publicis, Interpublic, and Dentsu.
In Latin, advertere means "to turn towards".
> Thought 2: From the search results, I understand that advertising is a practice that aims to bring attention to a product or service. It often seeks to generate increased consumption through branding and can also be used for non-commercial purposes. The claim states that advertising is a personal message, but the definition provided does not specifically mention that it is a personal message. I need to look up the definition of a personal message to compare it with the definition of advertising.
OK.
> Lookup[personal message]
No Results
> Thought 3: Since the lookup for "personal message" did not return any results, I should consider the general understanding of a personal message. A personal message is typically a communication intended for a specific individual or a small group of individuals, often conveying a personal or emotional message. Given the definition of advertising as a practice to bring attention to a product or service, it is not necessarily a personal message. Advertising is generally aimed at a broader audience rather than a specific individual.
OK.
> Thought 4: Based on the definition of advertising and the general understanding of a personal message, it appears that advertising is not inherently a personal message. Advertising is more about reaching a wide audience and promoting products or services, rather than being a personal communication. Therefore, the claim that "Advertising is a personal message" does not seem to be supported by the information provided.
OK.

Answer is CORRECT

Claim: Private Lives is a three act play from 1930.

2025-04-19 20:28:52 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about the play "Private Lives" to determine if it is indeed a three-act play from 1930.

Obs 2: OK.
2025-04-19 20:28:59 - Act 3: Search[Private Lives]
Obs 3: Private Lives is a 1930 comedy of manners in three acts by Noël Coward. It concerns a divorced couple who, while honeymooning with their new spouses, discover that they are staying in adjacent rooms at the same hotel.  Despite a perpetually stormy relationship, they realise that they still have feelings for each other. Its second-act love scene was nearly censored in Britain as too risqué. Coward wrote one of his most popular songs, ‘Someday I'll Find You’, for the play.
After touring the British provinces, the play opened the new Phoenix Theatre in London in 1930, starring Coward, Gertrude Lawrence, Adrianne Allen and Laurence Olivier. A Broadway production followed in 1931, and the play has been revived at least a half-dozen times each in the West End and on Broadway. The leading roles have attracted a wide range of actors:  among those who have succeeded Coward as Elyot are Robert Stephens, Richard Burton, Alan Rickman and Matthew Macfadyen, and successors to Lawrence as Amanda have included Tallulah Bankhead, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins, Elaine Stritch, Maggie Smith, Penelope Keith and Lindsay Duncan. Directors of new productions have included John Gielgud, Howard Davies and Richard Eyre. The play was made into a 1931 film and has been adapted several times for television and radio.
2025-04-19 20:29:01 - Act 4: Thought 2: The search result confirms that "Private Lives" is indeed a three-act play from 1930, as stated in the first sentence of the observation. No further action is needed to verify this claim.

## Key Insights from Related Tasks
The following are insights gathered during the execution of similar tasks. You may refer to them during your task execution to improve problem-solving accuracy.

1. Verify claims through multiple reliable sources and cross-reference with established data to ensure accuracy and avoid misinterpretation, because relying on a single source can lead to misinformation.
2. Eliminate unnecessary searches, because focusing on the core claim and relevant information improves efficiency and ensures that resources are used effectively, reducing the risk of introducing bias or misinformation.
3. Validate the context and timeline of claims with historical facts to ensure temporal accuracy and cross-referential consistency, because failing to do so can lead to incorrect conclusions about the timing of events and also helps in understanding the relevance and accuracy of the information.
4. When searching for information, use specific keywords, cross-reference with official and reputable sources, and verify claims against established facts to ensure accuracy and reliability, because relying solely on general searches can lead to missing relevant information and introduce bias.
5. Eliminate assumptions and cross-reference information across multiple sources and related topics to avoid incorrect conclusions and misinformation, because assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions and cross-referencing helps in verifying the accuracy of the information.

OK.
> Search[Shaun of the Dead]
Shaun of the Dead is a 2004 zombie comedy film directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg. Pegg stars as Shaun, a downtrodden London salesman who is caught alongside his loved ones in a zombie apocalypse. It also stars Nick Frost in his film debut, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, and Penelope Wilton. It is the first film in Wright and Pegg's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, followed by Hot Fuzz (2007) and The World's End (2013).
Shaun of the Dead was inspired by ideas Pegg and Wright used for their 1999-2001 television sitcom Spaced, particularly an episode in which Pegg's character hallucinates a zombie invasion. The film references the Night of the Living Dead films by George A. Romero. Principal photography took place across London and at Ealing Studios for nine weeks between May and June 2003.
Shaun of the Dead premiered in London on 29 March 2004, before it was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2004 and in the United States on 24 September. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing $38.7 million worldwide on a budget of $6.1 million and receiving two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards. It was ranked third on the Channel 4 list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films and quickly acquired a cult following. In film studies, it is seen as a product of post-9/11 anxiety and a model for transnational comedy, while the zombie outbreak as depicted in the film has been used as a modelling example for disease control.

Claim: Harold Macmillan was born on February 20, 1894.

>

2025-04-19 20:30:26 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Harold Macmillan and find his birth date.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:30:32 - Act 2: Search[Harold Macmillan]
Obs 2: Maurice Harold Macmillan, 1st Earl of Stockton (10 February 1894 – 29 December 1986) was a British statesman and Conservative politician who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1957 to 1963. Nicknamed "Supermac", he was known for his pragmatism, wit, and unflappability.
Macmillan was seriously injured as an infantry officer during the First World War. He suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life. After the war he joined his family book-publishing business, then entered Parliament at the 1924 general election for Stockton-on-Tees. Losing his seat in 1929, he regained it in 1931, soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton. He opposed the appeasement of Germany practised by the Conservative government. He rose to high office during the Second World War as a protégé of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In the 1950s Macmillan served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Anthony Eden.
When Eden resigned in 1957 following the Suez Crisis, Macmillan succeeded him as prime minister and Leader of the Conservative Party. He was a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition and supported the post-war consensus. He supported the welfare state and the necessity of a mixed economy with some nationalised industries and strong trade unions. He championed a Keynesian strategy of deficit spending to maintain demand and pursuit of corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth. Benefiting from favourable international conditions, he presided over an age of affluence, marked by low unemployment and high—if uneven—growth. In his speech of July 1957 he told the nation it had "never had it so good", but warned of the dangers of inflation, summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s. He led the Conservatives to success in 1959 with an increased majority.
In international affairs, Macmillan worked to rebuild the Special Relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the 1956 Suez Crisis (of which he had been one of the architects), and facilitated the decolonisation of Africa. Reconfiguring the nation's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age, he ended National Service, strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris, and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union. After the Skybolt Crisis undermined the Anglo-American strategic relationship, he sought a more active role for Britain in Europe, but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community and independent French acquisition of nuclear weapons in 1960. Near the end of his premiership, his government was rocked by the Vassall Tribunal and the Profumo affair, which to cultural conservatives and supporters of opposing parties alike seemed to symbolise moral decay of the British establishment. Following his resignation, Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman, being an active member of the House of Lords in his final years. He died in December 1986 at the age of 92.
2025-04-19 20:30:35 - Act 3: Thought 2: The observation states that Harold Macmillan was born on 10 February 1894, not 20 February 1894 as claimed. This directly contradicts the claim.

> Search[Shaun of the Dead]
Shaun of the Dead is a 2004 zombie comedy film directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg. Pegg stars as Shaun, a downtrodden London salesman who is caught alongside his loved ones in a zombie apocalypse. It also stars Nick Frost in his film debut, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, and Penelope Wilton. It is the first film in Wright and Pegg's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, followed by Hot Fuzz (2007) and The World's End (2013).
Shaun of the Dead was inspired by ideas Pegg and Wright used for their 1999-2001 television sitcom Spaced, particularly an episode in which Pegg's character hallucinates a zombie invasion. The film references the Night of the Living Dead films by George A. Romero. Principal photography took place across London and at Ealing Studios for nine weeks between May and June 2003.
Shaun of the Dead premiered in London on 29 March 2004, before it was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2004 and in the United States on 24 September. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing $38.7 million worldwide on a budget of $6.1 million and receiving two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards. It was ranked third on the Channel 4 list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films and quickly acquired a cult following. In film studies, it is seen as a product of post-9/11 anxiety and a model for transnational comedy, while the zombie outbreak as depicted in the film has been used as a modelling example for disease control.
> Thought 5: Since the information about "Shaun of the Dead" confirms that Edgar Wright directed this film, it supports the claim that Edgar Wright is a person, specifically a film director.
OK.
> Finish[SUPPORTS]
Answer is CORRECT

Claim: Aristotle spent time in Athens.

>

2025-04-19 20:42:12 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about Aristotle and his time in Athens.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:42:17 - Act 2: Search[Aristotle]
Obs 2: Aristotle (Attic Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης, romanized: Aristotélēs; 384–322 BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher and polymath. His writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology, and the arts. As the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens, he began the wider Aristotelian tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern science.
Little is known about Aristotle's life. He was born in the city of Stagira in northern Greece during the Classical period. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At around eighteen years old, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven (c. 347 BC). Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored his son Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. He established a library in the Lyceum, which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls.
Though Aristotle wrote many treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. His teachings and methods of inquiry have had a significant impact across the world, and remain a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.
Aristotle's views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. The influence of his physical science extended from late antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and was not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed. He influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church.
Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as "The First Teacher", and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as simply "The Philosopher", while the poet Dante called him "the master of those who know". He has been referred to as the first scientist. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, and were studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and Jean Buridan. His influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. In addition, his ethics, although always influential, has gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics.
2025-04-19 20:42:20 - Act 3: Thought 2: From the observation, it mentions that Aristotle joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). This indicates that Aristotle spent time in Athens during his time at the Academy.

Claim: David Packouz refused to be an entrepreneur.

2025-04-19 20:42:33 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about David Packouz to find out if he refused to be an entrepreneur.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:42:38 - Act 2: Search[David Packouz]
Obs 2: David Mordechai Packouz ( born February 17, 1982) is an American former arms dealer, convicted fraudster, musician and inventor. 
Packouz joined Efraim Diveroli on the 17th of September 2005, in Diveroli's arms company AEY Inc. By the end of 2006, the company had won 149 contracts worth around $10.5 million. In early 2007, AEY secured a nearly $300 million U.S. government contract to supply the Afghan Army with 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, aviation rockets and other munitions. The ammunition that AEY had secured in Albania to fulfill the contract had originally come from China, violating the terms of AEY's contract with the US Army, which bans Chinese ammunition. Packouz  was aware that the products were prohibited and would not be accepted, and was instrumental in the covering up of the origins of the ammunition. 
As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers – Packouz was 25 and Diveroli was 21 when AEY landed the ammunition deal – the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures.
Packouz was sentenced to seven months of house arrest for conspiracy to defraud the United States. He is the central subject of the 2016 Todd Phillips dramedy film War Dogs. Packouz himself has a cameo role in the film as a guitarist and singer at an elderly home.
Packouz later co-founded War Dogs Academy, an online school that teaches how to start a government contracting business. 
Packouz went on to invent a guitar pedal drum machine, the BeatBuddy, and is currently the CEO of music technology company Singular Sound.
2025-04-19 20:42:41 - Act 3: Thought 2: From the information found, David Packouz has co-founded an online school that teaches how to start a government contracting business and is currently the CEO of a music technology company. This suggests that he has engaged in entrepreneurial activities.

## Your Own Past Successes (Execution Patterns)
Here are examples of successful execution processes you've previously used on similar tasks.  
Pay special attention to the step-by-step procedures and strategies, especially when encountering obstacles:

Task 1:

### Task description:   
Claim: The Cretaceous ended.
- Environment feedback
You successfully finished this task.
    

### Key steps:
Search for Information: Look up information about the end of the Cretaceous period.
Find the End of Cretaceous: Identify that the Cretaceous ended with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.
Support the Claim: Confirm that the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, likely caused by an asteroid impact, supports the claim that the Cretaceous ended.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about the end of the Cretaceous period.
OK.
> Search[Cretaceous]
The Cretaceous (IPA:  krih-TAY-shəss) is a geological period that lasted from about 143.1 to 66 million years ago (Mya). It is the third and final period of the Mesozoic Era, as well as the longest. At around 77.1 million years, it is the ninth and longest geological period of the entire Phanerozoic. The name is derived from the Latin creta, 'chalk', which is abundant in the latter half of the period. It is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation Kreide.
The Cretaceous was a period with a relatively warm climate, resulting in high eustatic sea levels that created numerous shallow inland seas. These oceans and seas were populated with now-extinct marine reptiles, ammonites, and rudists, while dinosaurs continued to dominate on land. The world was largely ice-free, although there is some evidence of brief periods of glaciation during the cooler first half, and forests extended to the poles.
Many of the dominant taxonomic groups present in modern times can be ultimately traced back to origins in the Cretaceous. During this time, new groups of mammals and birds appeared, including the earliest relatives of placentals & marsupials (Eutheria and Metatheria respectively), with the earliest crown group birds appearing towards to the end of the Cretaceous. Teleost fish, the most diverse group of modern vertebrates continued to diversify during the Cretaceous with the appearance of their most diverse subgroup Acanthomorpha during this period. During the Early Cretaceous, flowering plants appeared and began to rapidly diversify, becoming the dominant group of plants across the Earth by the end of the Cretaceous, coincident with the decline and extinction of previously widespread gymnosperm groups.
The Cretaceous (along with the Mesozoic) ended with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a large mass extinction in which many groups, including non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and large marine reptiles, died out, widely thought to have been caused by the impact of a large asteroid that formed the Chicxulub crater in the Gulf of Mexico. The end of the Cretaceous is defined by the abrupt Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), a geologic signature associated with the mass extinction that lies between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras.
> Thought 2: The passage mentions that the Cretaceous ended with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which is widely thought to have been caused by the impact of a large asteroid. This information supports the claim that the Cretaceous ended.
OK.
> Finish[SUPPORTS]
Answer is CORRECT

## Key Insights from Related Tasks
The following are insights gathered during the execution of similar tasks. You may refer to them during your task execution to improve problem-solving accuracy.

1. Verify claims through multiple reliable sources and cross-reference with established data to ensure accuracy and avoid misinterpretation, because relying on a single source can lead to misinformation.
2. When searching for information, use specific keywords, cross-reference with official and reputable sources, and verify claims against established facts to ensure accuracy and reliability, because relying solely on general searches can lead to missing relevant information and introduce bias.
3. Eliminate unnecessary searches, because focusing on the core claim and relevant information improves efficiency and ensures that resources are used effectively, reducing the risk of introducing bias or misinformation.
4. Validate the context and timeline of claims with historical facts to ensure temporal accuracy and cross-referential consistency, because failing to do so can lead to incorrect conclusions about the timing of events and also helps in understanding the relevance and accuracy of the information.
5. Eliminate assumptions and cross-reference information across multiple sources and related topics to avoid incorrect conclusions and misinformation, because assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions and cross-referencing helps in verifying the accuracy of the information.

Written, produced by and starring Tenacious D members Jack Black and Kyle Gass, it is directed and co-written by musician and puppeteer Liam Lynch. Despite being about an actual band, the film is a fictitious story about the band's origins, and their journey to find a magical pick belonging to Satan that allows its users to become rock legends.
The film was released on November 22, 2006, and was a box office bomb. The soundtrack, The Pick of Destiny, was also released in 2006 as the band's second studio album. Despite the mixed box office reception of the film at release, it has since been considered a cult classic.
2025-04-19 20:44:03 - Act 7: Thought 4: The film 'Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny' is a fictional story about the band's origins, but it does not provide the actual year the band started. I need to find more information about the band's formation year.

There were three half-hour episodes total in the season, each containing two segments. The show included many songs that would later be re-recorded for the band's studio albums Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny.
In June 2020, the show was added to HBO Max.
2025-04-19 20:44:15 - Act 10: Thought 6: The information from the search indicates that Tenacious D had a limited television series that ran from 1997 to 2000. This suggests that the band started in 1997, which aligns with the claim.

2025-04-19 20:44:44 - Act 3: Thought 2: Since the direct search did not return the exact entity, I should look at the similar entities provided to find relevant information about James VI and I. The most relevant entities are "James VI and I and the English Parliament" and "James VI and I and the English Parliament," as they are likely to contain information about his views on parliaments in Scotland and England.
Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 20:44:49 - Act 4: Search[James VI and I and the English Parliament]
Obs 4: James I, the first king to reign in both England and Scotland, faced many difficulties with the Parliament of England. Though recent studies have shown that the Parliament of Scotland may have been more of a thorn in his side than was previously believed, James developed his political philosophy of the relationship between monarch and parliament in Scotland and reconciled himself to the independent stance of the English Parliament and its unwillingness to bow readily to his policies.
2025-04-19 20:44:53 - Act 5: Thought 3: The observation mentions that James I developed his political philosophy in Scotland and reconciled himself to the independent stance of the English Parliament. However, it does not explicitly state that he was a major advocate for a single parliament for Scotland and England. I need to look up more specific information about his views on a single parliament.

The information about James I and the English Parliament suggests that he had to deal with the independent stance of the English Parliament, which implies that he did not advocate for a single parliament. However, I should still check the other similar entities to ensure I have not missed any relevant information.
Obs 7: OK.
2025-04-19 20:45:04 - Act 8: Search[James VI and I and religious issues]
Obs 8: James VI and I (James Stuart) (19 June 1566 – 27 March 1625), King of Scotland, King of England and King of Ireland, faced many complicated religious challenges during his reigns in Scotland and England.
In Scotland, he inherited a reformed church, the Kirk, which was attempting to rid the country of bishops, dioceses, and parishes and establish a fully Presbyterian system, run by ministers and elders. However, James saw the bishops as the natural allies of the monarchy and frequently came into conflict with the Kirk in his sustained effort to reintroduce an episcopal polity to Scotland.
On his succession to the English throne in 1603, James was impressed by the church system he found there, which still adhered to an episcopate and supported the monarch's position as the head of the church. On the other hand, there were many more Roman Catholics in England than in Scotland, and James inherited a set of penal laws which he was constantly exhorted to enforce against them. Before ascending the English throne, James had assured the Earl of Northumberland that he would not persecute "any that will be quiet and give but an outward obedience to the law," but he soon reinforced strict penalties against Catholics. Partly triggered by Catholics' disillusionment with the new king, the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 led to a new wave of anti-Catholicism and even harsher legislation. In 1606, an oath of allegiance was introduced, though its enforcement later slackened. His policy of seeking a Spanish Match for his son, Charles, Prince of Wales, produced widespread opposition, particularly in the Commons, where members feared a revival of Catholic power in the country and a threat to the Protestant monarchy and state.
2025-04-19 20:45:08 - Act 9: Thought 5: The information provided does not mention James VI and I advocating for a single parliament. Instead, it discusses his religious policies and conflicts with both the Kirk in Scotland and the English Parliament. I need to look up more specific information about his views on a single parliament for Scotland and England.

2025-04-19 20:45:15 - Act 11: Thought 6: Since the direct search and lookup did not provide the necessary information, I should continue to explore the relevant entities provided and look for any mentions of a single parliament. The information about James VI and I and the English Parliament suggests that he had to deal with the independent stance of the English Parliament, which implies that he did not advocate for a single parliament. However, I should still check the other similar entities to ensure I have not missed any relevant information. Additionally, I should consider the historical context and the political structure of the time to understand the likelihood of a single parliament being advocated by James VI and I.
Obs 11: OK.
2025-04-19 20:45:19 - Act 12: Thought 7: Given the information found, James VI and I had to deal with the independent stance of the English Parliament and the Kirk in Scotland, which suggests he did not advocate for a single parliament. Additionally, the historical context of the time indicates that the idea of a single parliament for Scotland and England was not a common or practical concept during his reign. Therefore, it is unlikely that he was a major advocate for a single parliament.

> Thought 4: Since searching for Edgar Wright still did not return the exact entity, I should try to find information about him through the similar entities provided. The most relevant entities are 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Baby Driver', and 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World', as these are films directed by Edgar Wright.
OK.
> Search[Shaun of the Dead]
Shaun of the Dead is a 2004 zombie comedy film directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg. Pegg stars as Shaun, a downtrodden London salesman who is caught alongside his loved ones in a zombie apocalypse. It also stars Nick Frost in his film debut, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, and Penelope Wilton. It is the first film in Wright and Pegg's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, followed by Hot Fuzz (2007) and The World's End (2013).
Shaun of the Dead was inspired by ideas Pegg and Wright used for their 1999-2001 television sitcom Spaced, particularly an episode in which Pegg's character hallucinates a zombie invasion. The film references the Night of the Living Dead films by George A. Romero. Principal photography took place across London and at Ealing Studios for nine weeks between May and June 2003.
Shaun of the Dead premiered in London on 29 March 2004, before it was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2004 and in the United States on 24 September. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing $38.7 million worldwide on a budget of $6.1 million and receiving two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards. It was ranked third on the Channel 4 list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films and quickly acquired a cult following. In film studies, it is seen as a product of post-9/11 anxiety and a model for transnational comedy, while the zombie outbreak as depicted in the film has been used as a modelling example for disease control.
> Thought 5: Since the information about "Shaun of the Dead" confirms that Edgar Wright directed this film, it supports the claim that Edgar Wright is a person, specifically a film director.
OK.
> Finish[SUPPORTS]

Claim: Saxony is in Ireland.

>

2025-04-19 20:48:25 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Saxony to find information about its location.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:48:32 - Act 2: Search[Saxony]
Obs 2: The Saxons, sometimes called the Old Saxons or Continental Saxons, were a Germanic people of early medieval "Old" Saxony (Latin: Antiqua Saxonia) which became a Carolingian "stem duchy" in 804, in what is now northern Germany. Many of their neighbours were, like them, speakers of West Germanic dialects, including the inland Franks and Thuringians to the south, and the coastal Frisians and Angles to the north who were among the peoples who were originally referred to as "Saxons" in the context of early raiding and settlements in Roman Britain and Gaul. To their east were Obotrites and other Slavic-speaking peoples.
The political history of these continental Saxons is unclear until the 8th century and the conflict between their semi-legendary hero Widukind and the Frankish emperor Charlemagne. They do not appear to have been politically united until about the generations leading up to that conflict, and before then they were reportedly ruled by regional "satraps". Previous Frankish rulers of Austrasia, both Merovingian and Carolingian, fought numerous campaigns against Saxons, both in the west near the Lippe, Ems and Weser, and further east, near Thuringia and Bohemia, in the area which later medieval sources referred to as "North Swabia". 
Charlemagne conquered all the Saxons after winning the long Saxon Wars (772–804) and forced them to convert to Christianity, annexing Saxony into the Carolingian domain. Under the Carolingian Franks, Saxony became a single duchy, fitting it within the basic political structure of the later Holy Roman Empire. The early rulers of this Duchy of Saxony expanded their territories—and therefore those of the Holy Roman Empire—to the east, at the expense of Slavic-speaking Wends. 
Long before any clear historical mention of Saxony as a state, the name "Saxons" was also used to refer to coastal raiders who attacked the Roman Empire from north of the Rhine, in a similar sense to the much later term Viking. These early raiders and settlers included Frisians, Angles and Jutes, and the term Saxon was not at that time a term for any specific tribe. There is however a single possible classical reference to a smaller and much earlier Saxon tribe, but the interpretation of this text ("Axones" in most surviving manuscripts) is disputed. According to this proposal, the original Saxon tribe lived north of the mouth of the Elbe, close to the probable homeland of the Angles, in the Saxon area which came to be known later as Nordalbingia.
Today the Saxons of Germany no longer form a distinctive ethnic group or country, but their name lives on in the names of several regions and states of Germany, including Lower Saxony (German: Niedersachsen) which includes most of the original duchy. Their language evolved into Low German which was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League, but has faced a long and gradual decline since the Late Medieval period as a literary, administrative and, to a significant extent, cultural language in favor of Dutch and German.
2025-04-19 20:48:34 - Act 3: Thought 2: The observation mentions that Saxony is a region in northern Germany, not in Ireland. Therefore, the claim that Saxony is in Ireland is false.

Claim: In the End has baseball in it.

>

2025-04-19 20:48:49 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for "In the End" and find if it contains baseball.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:48:54 - Act 2: Search[In the End]
Obs 2: "In the End" is a song by American rock band Linkin Park. It is the eighth track on their debut album, Hybrid Theory (2000), and was released as the album's fourth and final single.
"In the End" received positive reviews by music critics, with most reviewers complimenting the song's signature piano riff, as well as noting rapper Mike Shinoda's vocal prominence in the song. "In the End" also achieved mainstream popularity, and was a commercial success upon release. The song reached the top ten on numerous worldwide music charts and reached number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, the band's highest peak on the chart, as well as their first song that peaked within the top 40 in early 2002, making it a sleeper hit. It ranked at number 121 in Blender magazine's The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born. In June 2021, it became the first nu metal song to surpass one billion streams on Spotify. As of April 2025, "In the End" ranks among the top 100 most streamed songs of all-time on Spotify with over 2.5 billion streams and has since been certified Diamond (10× Platinum) in their home country by the RIAA.
"In the End" has become one of Linkin Park's most recognizable hits and is considered their signature song. Chester Bennington, the band's lead vocalist, said he initially disliked the song and did not want it to be included on Hybrid Theory. It was remixed on Reanimation as "Enth E ND". The music video of the song, directed by Nathan Cox and the band's turntablist Joe Hahn, featured the band in a fantasy setting.
Ahead of the release for the 20th anniversary reissue for Hybrid Theory, Linkin Park released a demo version of "In the End" as the second single from the re-release of Hybrid Theory on October 1, 2020.
2025-04-19 20:48:58 - Act 3: Thought 2: The passage does not mention any reference to baseball in the song "In the End" by Linkin Park. It only discusses the song's release, popularity, and music video. Therefore, I need to look up the lyrics or any additional information to see if there is any mention of baseball.

On 9 October 2000 she released her first studio album, "Hot", which also included her number one duet with Missy Elliott for the song "I Want You Back".

A fourth single was released in February 2001, "Feels So Good", which peaked at No. 5, followed by a final single, "Lullaby", a pop number dedicated to her daughter. The single entered and peaked at No. 13. The album was not a success and garnered mediocre reviews, selling 7,419 copies in its first week and charting at No. 28, before quickly falling out of the charts, leading to Virgin dumping Brown from their label.

2025-04-19 20:50:12 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about Noah Cyrus and Macy Gray to find their relationships.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:50:17 - Act 2: Search[Noah Cyrus]
Obs 2: Noah Lindsey Cyrus (born January 8, 2000) is an American singer and actress. As a child actress, she voiced the titular character in the English dub of the film Ponyo (2008), and appeared in minor roles on shows including  Hannah Montana and Doc.

She was nominated for Best New Artist at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. Cyrus is the youngest child of Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus.
2025-04-19 20:50:19 - Act 3: Thought 2: From the observation, I know that Noah Cyrus is the youngest child of Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus. Now I need to find information about Macy Gray to determine their relationship.
Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 20:50:23 - Act 4: Search[Macy Gray]
Obs 4: Could not find [Macy Gray]. Similar: ['Macy Gray', 'Macy Gray discography', 'Sneaks (film)', 'Tal Wilkenfeld', 'The Masked Singer (American TV series) season 10', 'Will.i.am Music Group', 'Ruby (Macy Gray album)', 'The Very Best of Macy Gray', 'Dutch (2021 film)', 'Stripped (Macy Gray album)']
2025-04-19 20:50:25 - Act 5: Thought 3: Since I couldn't find Macy Gray directly, I should look for information about her discography or other related works to find any connection to Noah Cyrus.
Obs 5: OK.

Obs 6: The last page Searched was not found, so you cannot Lookup a keyword in it. Please try one of the similar pages given.
2025-04-19 20:50:28 - Act 7: Thought 3: Since I couldn't find Macy Gray directly or through her discography, I should try to find information about her family or background to determine if there is any connection to Noah Cyrus.
Obs 7: OK.
2025-04-19 20:50:33 - Act 8: Search[Macy Gray biography]
Obs 8: Natalie Renée McIntyre (born September 6, 1967), known professionally as Macy Gray, is an American R&B and soul singer and actress. She is known for her distinctive raspy voice and a singing style heavily influenced by Billie Holiday. As of 2018, she has sold over 25 million records worldwide.
Gray has released ten studio albums, and received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one. She has appeared in a number of films, including Training Day, Spider-Man, Scary Movie 3, Lackawanna Blues, Idlewild, For Colored Girls, and The Paperboy. Gray is best known for her international hit single "I Try", taken from her multi-platinum debut album On How Life Is. Gray was inducted into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2014 in her hometown of Canton, Ohio.
2025-04-19 20:50:35 - Act 9: Thought 4: From the information provided, Macy Gray is an American R&B and soul singer and actress, born on September 6, 1967. There is no mention of her being related to Billy Ray Cyrus or Noah Cyrus. I need to find a connection between Macy Gray and Noah Cyrus.
Obs 9: OK.
2025-04-19 20:50:40 - Act 10: Thought 5: Since Macy Gray's biography does not mention any connection to Noah Cyrus, I need to look for information that might indicate a familial relationship between them. Given that Noah Cyrus is the youngest child of Billy Ray Cyrus, I should search for information about Macy Gray's family background to see if there is any connection.
Obs 10: OK.
2025-04-19 20:50:44 - Act 11: Search[Billy Ray Cyrus and Macy Gray]
Obs 11: Could not find [Billy Ray Cyrus and Macy Gray]. Similar: ['Damon Elliott', 'List of television theme music', 'Camp Freddy', 'Glastonbury Festival line-ups', 'Russell Malone', 'David Campbell (composer)', 'List of American films of 2025', 'SZA', 'List of artists who reached number one on the Australian singles chart', 'Tupac Shakur']
2025-04-19 20:50:48 - Act 12: Thought 6: Since searching for a direct connection between Billy Ray Cyrus and Macy Gray did not yield any results, it seems unlikely that they are related. Given that Macy Gray was born in 1967 and Noah Cyrus in 2000, it is highly improbable that they are sisters. However, to be thorough, I should check if there is any indirect connection or if they have worked together, which might imply a familial relationship.
Obs 12: OK.
2025-04-19 20:50:52 - Act 13: Thought 7: Since direct searches for a familial or professional connection between Billy Ray Cyrus and Macy Gray did not yield any results, it is highly unlikely that Macy Gray is Noah Cyrus's sister. Given their birth years and the lack of any direct or indirect connection, the claim is likely false.
Obs 13: OK.

Task 1:

### Task description:   
Claim: There is a capital called Mogadishu.
- Environment feedback
You successfully finished this task.
    

### Key steps:
Search for Mogadishu: Look up information about Mogadishu.
Find Information: Locate the information that Mogadishu is the capital of Somalia.
Verify the Claim: Confirm that Mogadishu is indeed the capital based on the found information.
Support the Claim: Conclude that the claim is true.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Mogadishu to find information about its status as a capital.
OK.
> Search[Mogadishu]
Mogadishu, locally known as Xamar or Hamar, is the capital and most populous city of Somalia. The city has served as an important port connecting traders across the Indian Ocean for millennia and has an estimated urban population of 2,610,483.
Mogadishu is located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean, which, unlike other Somali regions, is considered a municipality rather than a maamul goboleed (federal state).
Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade and eventually came under the Ajuran Sultanate in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry. In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate. In the 19th century, it came under the Sultanate of the Geledi's sphere of influence.
In 1894, the Somali chief signed a treaty of peace, friendship, and protection with Filonardi of the Commercial Company of Benadir. The onset of Italian colonial rule occurred in stages, with treaties signed in the 1880s followed by economic engagement between Somali clans and the Commercial Company of Benadir, and then direct governance by the Italian Empire after 1906, British Military Administration of Somalia after World War II and the Trust Territory of Somaliland administered by Italy in the 1950s.
This was followed by independence in 1960, the Somali Democratic Republic era during Siad Barre's presidency (1969–1991). The three-decade long Somali Civil War afterwards devastated the city. As of the late 2010s and 2020s, a period of major reconstruction commenced.

OK.

Damon Albarn (, AWL-barn; born 23 March 1968) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is best known as the frontman and main vocalist of the rock band Blur and the co-creator and primary musical contributor of the virtual band Gorillaz.
Raised in Leytonstone, East London, and around Colchester, Essex, Albarn attended the Stanway School, where he met Graham Coxon, with whom he would later form Blur in 1988. They released their debut album Leisure in 1991.  After spending long periods touring the US, Albarn's songwriting became increasingly influenced by British bands from the 1960s. The result was the Blur albums Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). All three received critical acclaim, while Blur gained mass popularity in the UK, aided by a Britpop chart rivalry with Oasis. Chart-topping albums such as Blur (1997), 13 (1999) and Think Tank (2003) incorporated influences from lo-fi, art rock, electronic and world music. These were followed by The Magic Whip (2015), Blur's first studio album in 12 years, and The Ballad of Darren in 2023.
Albarn formed the virtual band Gorillaz in 1998 with the comic book artist Jamie Hewlett. Drawing influences from electronic, hip-hop and world music, Gorillaz released their self-titled debut album in 2001 to worldwide success, spawning numerous successful follow-ups and continuing to release albums and tour into the 2020s.  Albarn remains the group's only consistent musical contributor. His other notable projects have included the supergroups The Good, the Bad & the Queen and Rocket Juice & the Moon. He co-founded the non-profit musical organisation Africa Express and has composed film soundtracks. Albarn also scored the stage productions Monkey: Journey to the West (2008), Dr Dee (2012) and Wonder.land (2016). His debut solo album, Everyday Robots, was released in 2014, followed by The Nearer the Fountain, More Pure the Stream Flows in 2021.
In 2008, The Daily Telegraph named Albarn the 18th-most powerful person in British culture. In 2016, Albarn received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to music. In 2020, Albarn was granted Icelandic citizenship.

It comprises two glass bulbs connected vertically by a narrow neck that allows a regulated flow of a substance (historically sand) from the upper bulb to the lower one due to gravity. Typically, the upper and lower bulbs are symmetric as they are usually manufactured by pinching a tube. The specific duration of time a given hourglass measures is determined by factors including the quantity and coarseness of the particulate matter and the neck width.
Depictions of an hourglass as a symbol of the passage of time are found in art, especially on tombstones or other monuments, from antiquity to the present day. The form of a winged hourglass has been used as a literal depiction of the Latin phrase tempus fugit ("time flies").

Obs 4: A View to a Kill is a 1985 spy film, the fourteenth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, and the seventh and final appearance of Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Although the title is adapted from Ian Fleming's 1960 short story "From a View to a Kill", the film has an entirely original screenplay. In A View to a Kill, Bond is pitted against Max Zorin (played by Christopher Walken), who plans to destroy California's Silicon Valley.
The film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, who also wrote the screenplay with Richard Maibaum. It was the third James Bond film to be directed by John Glen, and the last to feature Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny.
Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, who frequently took umbrage with the effects of Moore's advanced age on his performance, and being disliked by Moore himself, it was a commercial success. The Duran Duran theme song "A View to a Kill" performed well in the charts, becoming the only Bond theme song to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Song. The film was followed by The Living Daylights in 1987, with Timothy Dalton replacing Moore as Bond.
2025-04-19 20:54:38 - Act 5: Thought 3: The information found indicates that "A View to a Kill" is a spy film, which is a subgenre of action movies. Therefore, the claim that "A View to a Kill" is an action movie is supported.

## Your Own Past Successes (Execution Patterns)
Here are examples of successful execution processes you've previously used on similar tasks.  
Pay special attention to the step-by-step procedures and strategies, especially when encountering obstacles:

Task 1:

### Task description:   
Claim: There is a capital called Mogadishu.
- Environment feedback
You successfully finished this task.
    

### Key steps:
Search for Mogadishu: Look up information about Mogadishu.
Find Information: Locate the information that Mogadishu is the capital of Somalia.
Verify the Claim: Confirm that Mogadishu is indeed the capital based on the found information.
Support the Claim: Conclude that the claim is true.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Mogadishu to find information about its status as a capital.
OK.
> Search[Mogadishu]
Mogadishu, locally known as Xamar or Hamar, is the capital and most populous city of Somalia. The city has served as an important port connecting traders across the Indian Ocean for millennia and has an estimated urban population of 2,610,483.
Mogadishu is located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean, which, unlike other Somali regions, is considered a municipality rather than a maamul goboleed (federal state).
Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade and eventually came under the Ajuran Sultanate in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry. In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate. In the 19th century, it came under the Sultanate of the Geledi's sphere of influence.
In 1894, the Somali chief signed a treaty of peace, friendship, and protection with Filonardi of the Commercial Company of Benadir. The onset of Italian colonial rule occurred in stages, with treaties signed in the 1880s followed by economic engagement between Somali clans and the Commercial Company of Benadir, and then direct governance by the Italian Empire after 1906, British Military Administration of Somalia after World War II and the Trust Territory of Somaliland administered by Italy in the 1950s.
This was followed by independence in 1960, the Somali Democratic Republic era during Siad Barre's presidency (1969–1991). The three-decade long Somali Civil War afterwards devastated the city. As of the late 2010s and 2020s, a period of major reconstruction commenced.
> Thought 2: The passage clearly states that Mogadishu is the capital of Somalia. Therefore, the claim is true.
OK.

Claim: Papua comprised all of Indonesia.

>

2025-04-19 20:55:04 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about Papua and its relation to Indonesia.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:55:09 - Act 2: Search[Papua]
Obs 2: Could not find [Papua]. Similar: ['Papua', 'Papua New Guinea', 'New Guinea', 'Papua (province)', 'Western New Guinea', 'Free Papua Movement', 'Papua conflict', 'West Papua (province)', 'Highland Papua', 'South Papua']
2025-04-19 20:55:11 - Act 3: Thought 2: From the similar entities, I should search for "Papua (province)" to find information about its relation to Indonesia.
Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 20:55:16 - Act 4: Search[Papua (province)]
Obs 4: Papua is a province of Indonesia, comprising the northern coast of Western New Guinea together with island groups in Cenderawasih Bay to the west. It roughly follows the borders of Papuan customary region of Tabi Saireri, and is divided into eight regencies (kabupaten) and one city (kota), the latter being the provincial capital of Jayapura.
It is bordered by nation of Papua New Guinea to the east, the Pacific Ocean to the north, Cenderawasih Bay to the west, and the provinces of Central Papua and Highland Papua to the south. The province also shares maritime boundaries with Palau in the Pacific. Papua, along with the five other Papuan provinces, has a higher degree of autonomy level compared to other Indonesian provinces.
Prior to 2003, the province (known as Irian Barat from 1962 to 1973 and Irian Jaya from 1973 to 2002) covered the entirety of Western New Guinea, a region also known as "Papua". In 2002, Papua adopted its current name and was granted a special autonomous status under Indonesian legislation. In 2001, the western end of the province was split off into a new province of West Papua, and in July 2022 the provinces of Central Papua, Highland Papua, and South Papua were also split off, leaving the current province covering a much smaller northern area around Jayapura, the northern part of the former province, and the islands in the Cenderawasih Bay. 
The official estimate of the population in mid 2024 of the province under its current borders was 1,060,550 (comprising 554,800 males and 505,800 females).
2025-04-19 20:55:19 - Act 5: Thought 3: The passage clearly states that Papua is a province of Indonesia, but it does not cover the entirety of Western New Guinea. It was previously known as Irian Barat and Irian Jaya, and it currently covers a much smaller northern area around Jayapura and some islands in Cenderawasih Bay. Therefore, the claim that Papua comprised all of Indonesia is not accurate.

> Thought 2: Since the exact entity "Charles Manson" could not be found, I will search for "Tate–LaBianca murders" as it is closely related to Charles Manson and his legal proceedings.
OK.
> Search[Tate–LaBianca murders]
The Tate–LaBianca murders were a series of murders perpetrated by members of the Manson Family during August 9–10, 1969, in Los Angeles, California, United States, under the direction of Tex Watson and Charles Manson. The perpetrators killed five people on the night of August 8–9: pregnant actress Sharon Tate and her companions Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger and Wojciech Frykowski, along with Steven Parent. The following evening, the Family murdered supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, at their home in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles.
On the night of August 8–9, four members of the Family – Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Linda Kasabian – drove from Spahn Ranch to 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, the home Tate shared with her husband, film director Roman Polanski. The group murdered Tate (who was 8½ months pregnant), and guests Sebring, a celebrity hairdresser; Folger, heiress to the Folgers coffee fortune; her boyfriend Frykowski, an aspiring screenwriter; and Parent, an 18-year-old visiting the guest house caretaker. Polanski was not home as he was working on a film in Europe. Manson was a cult leader and wannabe musician who had tried to get a contract with record producer Terry Melcher, who had previously rented the house.
The following night, the four participants in the Cielo Drive killings, in addition to Manson, Leslie Van Houten and Steve "Clem" Grogan, committed two more murders. Manson had allegedly said he would show them how to do it. Linda Kasabian drove the group to 3301 Waverly Drive.: 22–25, 42–48  Manson left with Atkins, Grogan and Kasabian in the car and told the others to hitchhike back to the ranch. Watson, Krenwinkel and Van Houten killed the couple in the early morning hours of August 10.

> Thought 4: Since the search for "legal proceedings" did not yield any results, I will look up "Charles Manson legal case" to find more specific information about the legal proceedings and verdicts related to Charles Manson.
OK.
> Search[Charles Manson legal case]
Charles Milles Manson (né Maddox; November 12, 1934 – November 19, 2017) was an American criminal, cult leader, and musician who led the Manson Family, a cult based in California in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some cult members committed a series of at least nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969. In 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, including the film actress Sharon Tate. The prosecution contended that, while Manson never directly ordered the murders, his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy.
Before the murders, Manson had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions. While gathering his cult following, he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry, chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, who introduced Manson to record producer Terry Melcher. In 1968, the Beach Boys recorded Manson's song "Cease to Exist", renamed "Never Learn Not to Love" as a single B-side, but Manson was uncredited. Afterward, he attempted to secure a record contract through Melcher, but was unsuccessful.
Manson would often talk about the Beatles, including their eponymous 1968 album. According to Los Angeles County District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi, Manson felt guided by his interpretation of the Beatles' lyrics and adopted the term "Helter Skelter" to describe an impending apocalyptic race war. During his trial, Bugliosi argued that Manson had intended to start a race war, although Manson and others disputed this. Contemporary interviews and trial witness testimony insisted that the Tate–LaBianca murders were copycat crimes intended to exonerate Manson's friend Bobby Beausoleil. Manson himself denied having ordered any murders. Nevertheless, he served his time in prison and died from complications from colon cancer in 2017.
> Thought 5: The information provided in the last search indicates that Charles Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, including Sharon Tate. This suggests that he has been proven guilty, not innocent, of the crimes he was charged with. Therefore, the claim that Charles Manson has been proven innocent of all crimes is false.
OK.

Claim: There are not rumors that Augustus' wife, Livia, poisoned him.

>

2025-04-19 20:56:56 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about Augustus and his wife Livia, specifically regarding any rumors of her poisoning him.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:57:02 - Act 2: Search[Augustus and Livia]
Obs 2: Livia Drusilla (30 January 59 BC – 
AD 29) was Roman empress from 27 BC to AD 14 as the wife of Augustus, the first Roman emperor. She was known as Julia Augusta after her formal adoption into the Julia gens in AD 14.
Livia was the daughter of senator Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus and his wife Alfidia. She married Tiberius Claudius Nero around 43 BC, and they had two sons, Tiberius and Drusus. In 38 BC, she divorced Tiberius Claudius Nero and married the political leader Octavian. The Senate granted Octavian the title Augustus in 27 BC, effectively making him emperor. In her role as Roman empress, Livia served as an influential confidant to her husband and was rumored to have been responsible for the deaths of several of his relatives, including his grandson Agrippa Postumus.
After Augustus died in AD 14, Tiberius was elevated, and Livia continued to exert political influence as the mother of the emperor until her death in AD 29. She was grandmother of the emperor Claudius, great-grandmother of the emperor Caligula, and great-great-grandmother of the emperor Nero. Livia was deified by Claudius in AD 42, bestowing her the title Diva Augusta.
2025-04-19 20:57:04 - Act 3: Thought 2: The information provided does not directly address rumors of Livia poisoning Augustus. I need to look up more specific information about rumors surrounding Livia and Augustus' death.
Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 20:57:05 - Act 4: Lookup[rumors]
Obs 4: (Result 1/2) After Mark Antony's suicide following the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Octavian returned to Rome triumphant; on 16 January 27 BC, the Senate bestowed upon him the honorary title of Augustus ("honorable" or "revered one"). Augustus rejected monarchical titles, instead choosing to refer to himself as Princeps Civitatis ("First Citizen of the State") or Princeps Senatus ("First among the Senate"). He and Livia formed the role model for Roman households. Despite their wealth and power, Augustus' family continued to live modestly in their house on the Palatine Hill. Livia would set the pattern for the noble Roman matrona. She wore neither excessive jewelry nor pretentious costumes; she took care of the household and her husband (often making his clothes herself), always faithful and dedicated. In 35 BC, Octavian gave Livia the unprecedented honor of ruling her own finances and dedicated a public statue to her. She owned and effectively administered copper mines in Gaul, estates of palm groves in Judea, and dozens of papyrus marshes in Egypt. She had her own circle of clients and pushed many protégés into political offices, including the grandfathers of the later emperors Galba and Otho.
With Augustus being the father of only one daughter (Julia by Scribonia), Livia revealed herself to be an ambitious mother and soon started to push her own sons, Tiberius and Drusus, into power. Drusus was a trusted general and married Augustus' favorite niece, Antonia Minor, having three children: the popular general Germanicus, Livilla, and the future emperor Claudius. Drusus was killed in a riding accident only a few years later, dying in 9 BC. This was also the same year in which Livia was honored by the dedication of the Ara Pacis Augustae as a birthday present. Tiberius married Augustus' daughter Julia in 11 BC and was ultimately adopted as Augustus' heir in AD 4.
Rumor had it that Livia was behind the death of Augustus' nephew Marcellus in 23 BC. After Julia's two elder sons by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, whom Augustus had adopted as sons and successors, had died, the one remaining son, Agrippa Postumus, was adopted at the same time as Tiberius, but later Agrippa Postumus was sent into exile and finally killed. Tacitus charges that Livia was not altogether innocent of these deaths and Cassius Dio also mentions such rumours. There are also rumors mentioned by Tacitus and Cassius Dio that Livia brought about Augustus' death by poisoning fresh figs, although modern historians view this as unlikely. Augustus' granddaughter was Julia the Younger. Sometime between AD 1 and 14, her husband Lucius Aemilius Paullus was executed as a conspirator in a revolt. Modern historians theorize that Julia's exile was not actually for adultery but for involvement in Paullus' revolt.  Tacitus alleged that Livia had plotted against her stepdaughter's family and ruined them. Julia died in AD 29 on the island to which she had been sent in exile twenty years earlier.
2025-04-19 20:57:07 - Act 5: Thought 3: The observation mentions that there are rumors suggesting Livia was responsible for Augustus' death by poisoning fresh figs. However, modern historians view this as unlikely. This suggests that while there are rumors, they are not substantiated by reliable historical evidence.
Obs 5: OK.

Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 20:57:42 - Act 4: Search[Jennifer Lopez discography]
Obs 4: American singer Jennifer Lopez has released nine studio albums, one remix album, three compilation albums, one soundtrack, one extended play, 66 singles (including 14 as a featured artist), five charity singles and 13 promotional singles. As of 2022, the singer has sold more than 80 million records with 15 billion streams worldwide. She made her chart debut in May 1999 with "If You Had My Love", which topped the charts in six countries, including the United States. It was followed by the release of her debut studio album, On the 6 (1999), which reached the top five in several countries and produced four additional singles, including the international hit "Waiting for Tonight". The simultaneous release of her second studio album, J.Lo, and the film, The Wedding Planner, in January 2001, made Lopez the first entertainer to have a number one film and album in the United States in the same week. The album was certified four-times platinum in the United States and yielded four hit singles, including "Love Don't Cost a Thing" and "I'm Real", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The following year saw the release of Lopez's remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes (2002), which became the first remix album in history to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, and went on to become one of the best selling remix albums of all time. Three singles were released from the album, including "Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks.
Lopez's third studio album, This Is Me... Then (2002), reached number two on the Billboard 200, and earned double-platinum status in the United States. Four singles were released from the album, including the hits "Jenny from the Block" and "All I Have", which topped the charts in the United States and New Zealand. Her fourth studio album, Rebirth (2005), charted moderately in the United States, eventually earning a platinum certification. It produced two singles, including its lead single, "Get Right", which went number one in five countries. Lopez's first full-length Spanish album, Como Ama una Mujer, was released in March 2007 and peaked at number ten on the US Billboard 200. Two singles were released from the album, most notably "Qué Hiciste", which was an international success and was certified eight-times platinum in Spain. A little over six months later, the singer released her sixth studio album, Brave (2007), which became her first album to miss the top ten on the Billboard 200. Just like the album, its lead single, "Do It Well", was only a moderate success.
Following a move to Island Records from Sony Music, Lopez released her seventh studio album, Love?, in May 2011, which was a moderately successful, but brief, comeback for her. Three singles were released from the album, including "On the Floor", which became the singer's most successful single in her career. The song topped more than eighteen national charts and sold more than 8.4 million digital copies globally, making it the best-selling single of 2011 by a female artist. Lopez's first greatest hits album, Dance Again... the Hits (2012), followed a year later and produced the international hit "Dance Again". Her eighth studio album, A.K.A., was released in June 2014 by Capitol Records and became her lowest-selling album in the US. Three singles were released from the album, including "Booty", which reached the top 20 in Canada and the United States. After A.K.A.'s underperformance, Lopez then departed from the label and returned to Epic Records. Instead of releasing studio albums, she released several standalone singles such as "Ain't Your Mama", "Dinero" and "Pa' Ti". In 2022, in collaboration with Maluma, she released a movie soundtrack. In 2024, she released a sequel album to This Is Me... Then entitled This Is Me... Now, her first studio album in a decade.
2025-04-19 20:57:44 - Act 5: Thought 3: The observation clearly states that Jennifer Lopez has released 66 singles (including 14 as a featured artist). This confirms that she has indeed made a single.

OK.
> Search[Shaun of the Dead]
Shaun of the Dead is a 2004 zombie comedy film directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg. Pegg stars as Shaun, a downtrodden London salesman who is caught alongside his loved ones in a zombie apocalypse. It also stars Nick Frost in his film debut, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, and Penelope Wilton. It is the first film in Wright and Pegg's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, followed by Hot Fuzz (2007) and The World's End (2013).
Shaun of the Dead was inspired by ideas Pegg and Wright used for their 1999-2001 television sitcom Spaced, particularly an episode in which Pegg's character hallucinates a zombie invasion. The film references the Night of the Living Dead films by George A. Romero. Principal photography took place across London and at Ealing Studios for nine weeks between May and June 2003.
Shaun of the Dead premiered in London on 29 March 2004, before it was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2004 and in the United States on 24 September. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing $38.7 million worldwide on a budget of $6.1 million and receiving two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards. It was ranked third on the Channel 4 list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films and quickly acquired a cult following. In film studies, it is seen as a product of post-9/11 anxiety and a model for transnational comedy, while the zombie outbreak as depicted in the film has been used as a modelling example for disease control.

Claim: A working animal is trained to perform life saving tasks.

>

2025-04-19 20:58:02 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for "working animal" to find information about them and their roles, specifically if they are trained to perform life-saving tasks.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 20:58:07 - Act 2: Search[working animal]
Obs 2: A working animal is an animal, usually domesticated, that is kept by humans and trained to perform tasks instead of being slaughtered to harvest animal products. Some are used for their physical strength (e.g. oxen and draft horses) or for transportation (e.g. riding horses and camels), while others are service animals trained to execute certain specialized tasks (e.g. hunting and guide dogs, messenger pigeons, and fishing cormorants). They may also be used for milking or herding. Some, at the end of their working lives, may also be used for meat or leather.
The history of working animals may predate agriculture as dogs were used by hunter-gatherer ancestors; around the world, millions of animals work in relationship with their owners. Domesticated species are often bred for different uses and conditions, especially horses and working dogs. Working animals are usually raised on farms, though some are still captured from the wild, such as dolphins and some Asian elephants.
2025-04-19 20:58:09 - Act 3: Thought 2: The definition provided does not explicitly mention life-saving tasks. I should look up information on service animals, which are often trained to perform specialized tasks, including life-saving ones.

For instance, guide dogs, search and rescue dogs, and other specialized service animals are often trained for life-saving tasks.
Obs 9: OK.
2025-04-19 20:58:26 - Act 10: Thought 6: I should search for specific examples of service animals known for performing life-saving tasks, such as guide dogs, search and rescue dogs, and other specialized service animals.
Obs 10: OK.
2025-04-19 20:58:31 - Act 11: Search[guide dogs]
Obs 11: Guide dogs  (colloquially known in the US as seeing-eye dogs) are assistance dogs trained to lead people who are blind or visually impaired around obstacles. Although dogs can be trained to navigate various obstacles, they are red–green colour blind and incapable of interpreting street signs. The human does the directing, based on skills acquired through previous mobility training. The handler might be likened to an aircraft's navigator, who must know how to get from one place to another, and the dog is the pilot, who gets them there safely. In several countries guide dogs, along with most other service and hearing dogs, are exempt from regulations against the presence of animals in places such as restaurants and public transportation.
2025-04-19 20:58:35 - Act 12: Thought 7: The information about guide dogs does not directly mention life-saving tasks, but they are trained to assist visually impaired individuals, which can be life-saving in certain situations (e.g., avoiding obstacles that could cause injury). I should look up information on search and rescue dogs to see if they are trained for life-saving tasks.
Obs 12: OK.
2025-04-19 20:58:41 - Act 13: Search[search and rescue dogs]
Obs 13: A search-and-rescue (SAR) dog is a dog trained to respond to crime scenes, accidents, missing persons events, as well as natural or man-made disasters. These dogs detect human scent, which is a distinct odor of skin flakes and water and oil secretions unique to each person and have been known to find people under water, snow, and collapsed buildings, as well as remains buried underground. SAR dogs are a non-invasive aid in the location of humans, alive or deceased.
2025-04-19 20:58:43 - Act 14: Thought 8: The information about search and rescue dogs clearly states that they are trained to detect human scent and locate people in various dangerous situations, which is a life-saving task. This supports the claim that working animals are trained to perform life-saving tasks.
Obs 14: OK.
2025-04-19 20:58:45 - Act 15: Thought 9: Since the information about search and rescue dogs directly supports the claim that working animals are trained to perform life-saving tasks, I can conclude that the claim is supported.

## Your Own Past Successes (Execution Patterns)
Here are examples of successful execution processes you've previously used on similar tasks.  
Pay special attention to the step-by-step procedures and strategies, especially when encountering obstacles:

Task 1:

### Task description:   
Claim: Advertising is a personal message.
- Environment feedback
You successfully finished this task.
    

### Key steps:
Search for Information: Look up the definition of advertising to understand its practice and techniques.
Understand Advertising: Advertising is a practice that aims to bring attention to a product or service, often through commercial advertisement and branding.
Consider Non-Commercial Uses: Recognize that advertising can also be used for non-commercial purposes, such as political or non-profit organizations.
Define Personal Message: Understand that a personal message is typically intended for a specific individual or small group, conveying a personal or emotional message.
Compare Definitions: Compare the definition of advertising with that of a personal message, noting that advertising is generally aimed at a broader audience.
Conclude: Conclude that advertising is not inherently a personal message, as it is more about reaching a wide audience and promoting products or services.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about advertising to understand its definition and characteristics.
OK.
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about advertising to understand its definition and characteristics.
OK.
> Search[Advertising]
Advertising is the practice and techniques employed to bring attention to a product or service. Advertising aims to present a product or service in terms of utility, advantages, and qualities of interest to consumers. It is typically used to promote a specific good or service, but there are a wide range of uses, the most common being commercial advertisement.
Commercial advertisements often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through "branding", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct-response advertising. Non-commercial entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations, and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement. Advertising may also help to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful.
In the 19th century, soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns. Thomas J. Barratt was hired by Pears to be its brand manager—the first of its kind—and in addition to creating slogans and images, he recruited West End stage actress and socialite Lillie Langtry to become the poster girl for Pears, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product. Modern advertising originated with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays, considered the founder of modern, "Madison Avenue" advertising.
Worldwide spending on advertising in 2015 amounted to an estimated US$529.43 billion. Advertising's projected distribution for 2017 was 40.4% on TV, 33.3% on digital, 9% on newspapers, 6.9% on magazines, 5.8% on outdoor, and 4.3% on radio. Internationally, the largest ("Big Five") advertising agency groups are Omnicom, WPP, Publicis, Interpublic, and Dentsu.
In Latin, advertere means "to turn towards".
> Thought 2: From the search results, I understand that advertising is a practice that aims to bring attention to a product or service. It often seeks to generate increased consumption through branding and can also be used for non-commercial purposes. The claim states that advertising is a personal message, but the definition provided does not specifically mention that it is a personal message. I need to look up the definition of a personal message to compare it with the definition of advertising.
OK.
> Lookup[personal message]
No Results
> Thought 3: Since the lookup for "personal message" did not return any results, I should consider the general understanding of a personal message. A personal message is typically a communication intended for a specific individual or a small group of individuals, often conveying a personal or emotional message. Given the definition of advertising as a practice to bring attention to a product or service, it is not necessarily a personal message. Advertising is generally aimed at a broader audience rather than a specific individual.
OK.
> Thought 4: Based on the definition of advertising and the general understanding of a personal message, it appears that advertising is not inherently a personal message. Advertising is more about reaching a wide audience and promoting products or services, rather than being a personal communication. Therefore, the claim that "Advertising is a personal message" does not seem to be supported by the information provided.
OK.
> Finish[REFUTES]
Answer is CORRECT

2025-04-19 20:59:44 - Act 11: Thought 7: Given that searching for "Billboard Dad" and related terms did not yield any relevant results, and the similar entities provided are not related to music genres, it is highly likely that "Billboard Dad" is not a recognized genre of music.

Claim: Vedam was written and directed by Christopher Nolan.

>

2025-04-19 21:00:03 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for "Vedam" to find information about its writing and direction.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:00:08 - Act 2: Search[Vedam]
Obs 2: The Vedas ( or ; Sanskrit: वेदः, romanized: Vēdaḥ, lit. 'knowledge'), sometimes collectively called the Veda, are a large body of religious texts originating in ancient India. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism.
There are four Vedas: the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda. Each Veda has four subdivisions – the Samhitas (mantras and benedictions), the Brahmanas (commentaries on and explanation of rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices – Yajñas), the Aranyakas (text on rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices), and the Upanishads (texts discussing meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge). Some scholars add a fifth category – the Upāsanās (worship). The texts of the Upanishads discuss ideas akin to the heterodox sramana traditions. The Samhitas and Brahmanas describe daily rituals and are generally meant for the Brahmacharya and Gr̥hastha stages of the Chaturashrama system, while the Aranyakas and Upanishads are meant for the Vānaprastha and Sannyasa stages, respectively.
Vedas are śruti ("what is heard"), distinguishing them from other religious texts, which are called smr̥ti ("what is remembered"). Hindus consider the Vedas to be apauruṣeya, which means "not of a man, superhuman" and "impersonal, authorless", revelations of sacred sounds and texts heard by ancient sages after intense meditation.
The Vedas have been orally transmitted since the 2nd millennium BCE with the help of elaborate mnemonic techniques. The mantras, the oldest part of the Vedas, are recited in the modern age for their phonology rather than the semantics, and are considered to be "primordial rhythms of creation", preceding the forms to which they refer. By reciting them the cosmos is regenerated, "by enlivening and nourishing the forms of creation at their base."
The various Indian philosophies and Hindu sects have taken differing positions on the Vedas. Schools of Indian philosophy that acknowledge the importance or primal authority of the Vedas comprise Hindu philosophy specifically and are together classified as the six "orthodox" (āstika) schools. However, śramaṇa traditions, such as Charvaka, Ajivika, Buddhism, and Jainism, which did not regard the Vedas as authoritative, are referred to as "heterodox" or "non-orthodox" (nāstika) schools.
2025-04-19 21:00:10 - Act 3: Thought 2: The search result does not mention Christopher Nolan or any film named Vedam. It seems to be about the ancient Indian scriptures called the Vedas. I need to search for "Vedam (film)" to find information about a potential film.

Obs 4: Vedam (transl. Chant) is a 2010 Indian Telugu-language melodrama anthology hyperlink film written and directed by Krish, and produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni under their banner Arka Media Works.

Claim: Men in Black II stars eight children.

>

2025-04-19 21:02:08 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about the cast of Men in Black II and count the number of child actors.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:02:13 - Act 2: Search[Men in Black II cast]
Obs 2: Men in Black II (stylized as MIIB) is a 2002 American science fiction action comedy film based on the Marvel Comics series of a similar name based on the conspiracy theory. Produced by Columbia Pictures and Amblin Entertainment in association with MacDonald Parkes Productions, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing, it is the sequel to Men in Black (1997) and the second installment in the Men in Black film series. The film was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld from a screenplay by Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro, and it stars Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, with Lara Flynn Boyle, Johnny Knoxville, Rosario Dawson, Tony Shalhoub, and Rip Torn in supporting roles. It featured Michael Jackson's last theatrical film appearance before his death in 2009. In the film, the emergence of an alien threat reunites Kevin Brown / Agent K (Jones) and James Darrell Edwards III / Agent J (Smith).
Development for a sequel film began following the box office success of the original; Jones, Smith, and Sonnenfeld's returns were confirmed by 2001, and David Koepp was initially hired to write the screenplay. Koepp then left production to work on Spider-Man (2002) and was replaced with Gordon, who developed the script and story further. Fanaro was later brought in to perform some final rewrites to Gordon's treatment. Principal photography began on June 11, 2001 and lasted until that September, taking place primarily in New York City; filming was delayed and several scenes were reworked following the September 11 attacks that month. The film's soundtrack contained the theme song "Black Suits Comin' (Nod Ya Head)", performed by Smith. Aside from this song, composer Danny Elfman, who scored the first film, returned to compose its sequel.
Men in Black II premiered at Mann Village Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles on June 26, 2002, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 3 of that same year. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, who deemed it inferior to its predecessor, but praised Jones's and Smith's performances and action sequences. Nonetheless, it was a financial success, grossing $445.1 million worldwide and becoming the fifth-highest grossing film of 2002. Its sequel, Men in Black 3, was released in 2012 to an improved critical and commercial response.
2025-04-19 21:02:17 - Act 3: Thought 2: From the search result, I can see that the main cast includes Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Lara Flynn Boyle, Johnny Knoxville, Rosario Dawson, Tony Shalhoub, and Rip Torn. I need to check if there are any child actors in the cast.
Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 21:02:18 - Act 4: Lookup[child actors]
Obs 4: No Results
2025-04-19 21:02:21 - Act 5: Thought 3: Since the search for "child actors" did not yield any results, I will need to infer from the cast list provided. The main cast members are adults, and there is no mention of any child actors in the cast list. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that there are no child actors in the film.

After protests against his return from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time.
Known for his extraordinary court vision, passing abilities, and leadership, Johnson was one of the most dominant players of his era. His career achievements include three NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, three NBA Finals MVPs, nine All-NBA First Team designations, and twelve All-Star games selections. He led the league in regular season assists four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game in both the regular season (11.19 assists per game) and the playoffs (12.35 assists per game). He also holds the records for most career playoff assists and most career playoff triple-doubles. Johnson was the co-captain of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team ("The Dream Team"), which won the Olympic gold medal in Barcelona; Johnson hence became one of eight players to achieve the basketball Triple Crown. After leaving the NBA in 1991, he formed the Magic Johnson All-Stars, a barnstorming team that traveled around the world playing exhibition games.
Johnson was honored as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021, and became a two-time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame—being enshrined in 2002 for his individual career and as a member of the Dream Team in 2010. His friendship and rivalry with Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, whom he faced in the 1979 NCAA finals and three NBA championship series, are well-documented.
Since his retirement, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/AIDS prevention and safe sex, as well as an entrepreneur, philanthropist, broadcaster, and motivational speaker. Johnson is a former part-owner of the Lakers and was the team's president of basketball operations in the late 2010s. He is a founding member of Guggenheim Baseball Management, managing entity of MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers, and is additionally part of ownership groups of the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, MLS' Los Angeles FC, the NFL's Washington Commanders, and the NWSL's Washington Spirit. Johnson has won 15 total championships during his career; one in college, five as an NBA player, and nine as an owner. Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the United States, in 2025.

Obs 9: Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (MMPR) is an American superhero television series that premiered on August 28, 1993, on the Fox Kids programming block. It is the first entry of the Power Rangers franchise, and became a 1990s pop culture phenomenon along with a large line of toys, action figures, and other merchandise. The show adapted stock footage from the Japanese TV series Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger (1992–1993), which was the 16th installment of Toei's Super Sentai franchise. The second and third seasons of the show drew elements and stock footage from Gosei Sentai Dairanger and Ninja Sentai Kakuranger, respectively, though the Zyuranger costumes were still used for the lead cast in these two seasons. Only the mecha and the Kiba Ranger (White Ranger) costume from Dairanger were featured in the second season while only the Kakuranger mecha was featured in the third season, though the Kakuranger costumes were later used for the mini-series Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers. The series was produced by MMPR Productions and distributed by Saban Entertainment, while the show's merchandise was produced and distributed by Bandai Entertainment.
While a global storyline would continue in Power Rangers Zeo, Power Rangers Turbo, Power Rangers in Space, and Power Rangers Lost Galaxy (which could be considered respectively and unofficially as the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons of the original series), the subsequent series would not be sequels or spin-offs in the traditional sense, having self-contained plots with no strong connection with the original series (except taking place in the same universe, not being reboots). The exceptions would be Power Rangers Dino Thunder, which could be considered as a continuation of the original classic series by having the presence of the character Tommy Oliver (the Green Ranger and later White Ranger, portrayed by Jason David Frank) as part of the regular team of Rangers of the generation of that series (in some of the other series the character only made special participations). Another series connected to the original classic series would be Power Rangers Operation Overdrive, as one of the main villains of this series, Thrax, is the son of Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, main villains of the classic series.
In 2010, a remake of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, with a revised new look of the original 1993 logo, comic book-referenced graphics, and extra alternative visual effects, was broadcast on ABC Kids, and Bandai produced brand new toys to coincide with the series. Only the first 32 of season one's 60 episodes were remade. It was the final Power Rangers season to air on ABC Kids as Haim Saban re-acquired the franchise from Disney, who took over the rights in 2002. With the beginning of Power Rangers Samurai in 2011, the franchise had moved to Nickelodeon.
The original series also spawned the feature film Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, released by 20th Century Fox on June 30, 1995. Despite mixed reviews, it was a success at the box office, and earned a cult following. In 1997, a second film titled Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie was released as a bridge between the series Power Rangers Zeo and Power Rangers Turbo. In 2017, a reboot film based on the original series was distributed by Lionsgate, simply titled Power Rangers. Due to both the film's financial failure and Hasbro's acquisition of the franchise in 2018, another reboot is in development.
A television special titled Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once & Always commemorated the 30th anniversary of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and premiered on Netflix on April 19, 2023, with returning cast members David Yost, Walter Emanuel Jones, Steve Cardenas, Johnny Yong Bosch, Karan Ashley, Catherine Sutherland, Barbara Goodson, and Richard Steven Horvitz who reprised their roles. Charlie Kersh portrayed Minh, the daughter of Trini Kwan and the third Yellow Ranger.

The Vedas ( or ; Sanskrit: वेदः, romanized: Vēdaḥ, lit. 'knowledge'), sometimes collectively called the Veda, are a large body of religious texts originating in ancient India. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism.
There are four Vedas: the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda. Each Veda has four subdivisions – the Samhitas (mantras and benedictions), the Brahmanas (commentaries on and explanation of rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices – Yajñas), the Aranyakas (text on rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices), and the Upanishads (texts discussing meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge). Some scholars add a fifth category – the Upāsanās (worship). The texts of the Upanishads discuss ideas akin to the heterodox sramana traditions. The Samhitas and Brahmanas describe daily rituals and are generally meant for the Brahmacharya and Gr̥hastha stages of the Chaturashrama system, while the Aranyakas and Upanishads are meant for the Vānaprastha and Sannyasa stages, respectively.
Vedas are śruti ("what is heard"), distinguishing them from other religious texts, which are called smr̥ti ("what is remembered"). Hindus consider the Vedas to be apauruṣeya, which means "not of a man, superhuman" and "impersonal, authorless", revelations of sacred sounds and texts heard by ancient sages after intense meditation.
The Vedas have been orally transmitted since the 2nd millennium BCE with the help of elaborate mnemonic techniques. The mantras, the oldest part of the Vedas, are recited in the modern age for their phonology rather than the semantics, and are considered to be "primordial rhythms of creation", preceding the forms to which they refer. By reciting them the cosmos is regenerated, "by enlivening and nourishing the forms of creation at their base."
The various Indian philosophies and Hindu sects have taken differing positions on the Vedas. Schools of Indian philosophy that acknowledge the importance or primal authority of the Vedas comprise Hindu philosophy specifically and are together classified as the six "orthodox" (āstika) schools. However, śramaṇa traditions, such as Charvaka, Ajivika, Buddhism, and Jainism, which did not regard the Vedas as authoritative, are referred to as "heterodox" or "non-orthodox" (nāstika) schools.
> Thought 2: The search result does not mention Christopher Nolan or any film named Vedam. It seems to be about the ancient Indian scriptures called the Vedas. I need to search for "Vedam (film)" to find information about a potential film.
OK.
> Search[Vedam (film)]
Vedam (transl. Chant) is a 2010 Indian Telugu-language melodrama anthology hyperlink film written and directed by Krish, and produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni under their banner Arka Media Works. The film features an ensemble cast consisting of Allu Arjun, Manchu Manoj, Anushka Shetty, Manoj Bajpayee, Saranya Ponvannan, Nagayya, Deeksha Seth, and Lekha Washington. M. M. Keeravani composed the music while Gnana Shekar V. S. did the cinematography.
Broadly falling into the hyperlink cinema genre, the film was critically acclaimed and won multiple awards, including four Filmfare Awards (Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress). Film Companion included Vedam in their list of 25 Greatest Telugu Films Of The Decade. Krish later remade the film in Tamil as Vaanam (2011).

Claim: The Adventures of Pluto Nash was reviewed by Ron Underwood.

>

2025-04-19 21:04:33 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" to find information about the movie and its reviews. Then, I will check if Ron Underwood is mentioned as a reviewer.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:04:38 - Act 2: Search[The Adventures of Pluto Nash]
Obs 2: The Adventures of Pluto Nash is a 2002 American science fiction action comedy film directed by Ron Underwood and starring Eddie Murphy (in a dual role), Randy Quaid, Rosario Dawson, Joe Pantoliano, Jay Mohr, Luis Guzmán, James Rebhorn, Peter Boyle, Pam Grier, and John Cleese. The film was released in the United States on August 16, 2002.
A critical and financial failure, the film was universally panned by moviegoers and critics alike. It is notable for being one of the biggest box office bombs of all time, grossing just over $7.1 million on a budget of $100 million.
2025-04-19 21:04:41 - Act 3: Thought 2: The search result does not mention Ron Underwood as a reviewer. It only mentions that Ron Underwood directed the film. I need to look up reviews of the film to see if Ron Underwood is mentioned as a reviewer.
Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 21:04:42 - Act 4: Lookup[review]
Obs 4: (Result 1/2) 
== Production ==
Ron Underwood was dissatisfied with the results of the film as he was shooting it. "I knew we didn't have the kind of wit and the fun that I would want...I felt that it was not really working fully...But it wasn't very obvious how to correct it." He praised the talents of the cast and crew and said that he enjoyed working with Eddie Murphy, but said that Murphy "wasn't feeling that funny, I don't think." The result was that Underwood was on the production for four years. A review of a version of the film (with no special effects) that was published on Ain't It Cool News in January 2001 did not help matters, as Castle Rock Entertainment became spooked and commissioned two weeks of reshoots in Los Angeles that pushed the film's budget to $100 million and miss a release date intended to be in April 2001.
2025-04-19 21:04:45 - Act 5: Thought 3: The observation does not mention Ron Underwood as a reviewer. It only discusses his role as the director and some production details. I need to look for reviews of the film to see if Ron Underwood is mentioned as a reviewer.
Obs 5: OK.
2025-04-19 21:04:45 - Act 6: Lookup[review]
Obs 6: (Result 2/2) 
=== Critical response ===
The Adventures of Pluto Nash was critically panned. Rotten Tomatoes ranked the film 79th in the 100 worst 2000s decade movies list, with a rating of 6% based on 89 reviews. The critical consensus states, "The Adventures of Pluto Nash is neither adventurous nor funny, and Eddie Murphy is on autopilot in this notorious box office bomb." On Metacritic, it holds a 12 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, meaning “overwhelming dislike”. Joe Leydon was one of the few critics to give it a positive review calling it "a prodigious popcorn flick that may be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since Town and Country". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "C−" on an A+ to F scale.
Pluto Nash was nominated for five Golden Raspberry Awards in 2003 including Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Eddie Murphy), Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Screen Couple (Murphy and himself cloned), but failed to win any. It was later nominated for Worst Comedy of Our First 25 Years at the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards in 2005, but lost to Gigli.
Eddie Murphy poked fun at himself in an interview with Barbara Walters, saying, "I know the two or three people that liked this movie."
About the movie's reception, Joe Pantoliano said: "You usually can’t tell when a movie is going to be shit, but on that one you could. And I think Ron Underwood, the director, got victimized by that, because that guy is good. But because of the material and the style in which some players came to work, we were off the mark, you know? A lot of hanky-panky going on there. So, I wasn’t surprised. I was surprised it turned out to be better than I thought it was going to be."
Director Ron Underwood expressed regret that the movie didn't have a "core piece of storytelling like the mid-life crisis" and said he thinks "the film was not very good."
2025-04-19 21:04:49 - Act 7: Thought 4: The observation mentions Ron Underwood expressing regret about the movie and saying he thinks "the film was not very good." However, it does not explicitly state that he reviewed the film. Given the context, it seems he is more of a director and a participant in the film's production rather than a reviewer.

Claim: Hedda Gabler's world premiere took place at the Battle of Hastings.

>

2025-04-19 21:05:10 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about the world premiere of Hedda Gabler and the Battle of Hastings to find out if there is any connection between them.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:05:15 - Act 2: Search[Hedda Gabler world premiere]
Obs 2: Hedda Gabler (Norwegian pronunciation: [ˈhɛ̂dːɑ ˈɡɑ̀ːblər]) is a play written by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. The world premiere was staged on 31 January 1891 at the Residenztheater in Munich. Ibsen himself was in attendance, although he remained back-stage. The play has been canonized as a masterpiece within the genres of literary realism, nineteenth century theatre, and world drama.  Ibsen mainly wrote realistic plays until his forays into modern drama. Hedda Gabler dramatizes the experiences of the title character, Hedda, the daughter of a general, who is trapped in a marriage and a house that she does not want. Overall, the title character for Hedda Gabler is considered one of the great dramatic roles in theater. The year following its publication, the play received negative feedback and reviews. Hedda Gabler has been described as a female variation of Hamlet. 
Hedda's married name is Hedda Tesman; Gabler is her maiden name. On the subject of the title, Ibsen wrote: "My intention in giving it this name was to indicate that Hedda as a personality is to be regarded rather as her father's daughter than her husband's wife."
2025-04-19 21:05:18 - Act 3: Thought 2: The information found indicates that the world premiere of Hedda Gabler took place in Munich, not at the Battle of Hastings. The Battle of Hastings was a historical event that occurred in 1066, which is unrelated to the premiere of a play that took place in 1891.
Obs 3: OK.

Here are examples of successful execution processes you've previously used on similar tasks.  
Pay special attention to the step-by-step procedures and strategies, especially when encountering obstacles:

Task 1:

### Task description:   
Claim: Advertising is a personal message.
- Environment feedback
You successfully finished this task.
    

### Key steps:
Search for Information: Look up the definition of advertising to understand its practice and techniques.
Understand Advertising: Advertising is a practice that aims to bring attention to a product or service, often through commercial advertisement and branding.
Consider Non-Commercial Uses: Recognize that advertising can also be used for non-commercial purposes, such as political or non-profit organizations.
Define Personal Message: Understand that a personal message is typically intended for a specific individual or small group, conveying a personal or emotional message.
Compare Definitions: Compare the definition of advertising with that of a personal message, noting that advertising is generally aimed at a broader audience.
Conclude: Conclude that advertising is not inherently a personal message, as it is more about reaching a wide audience and promoting products or services.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about advertising to understand its definition and characteristics.
OK.
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about advertising to understand its definition and characteristics.
OK.
> Search[Advertising]
Advertising is the practice and techniques employed to bring attention to a product or service. Advertising aims to present a product or service in terms of utility, advantages, and qualities of interest to consumers. It is typically used to promote a specific good or service, but there are a wide range of uses, the most common being commercial advertisement.
Commercial advertisements often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through "branding", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct-response advertising. Non-commercial entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations, and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement. Advertising may also help to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful.
In the 19th century, soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns. Thomas J. Barratt was hired by Pears to be its brand manager—the first of its kind—and in addition to creating slogans and images, he recruited West End stage actress and socialite Lillie Langtry to become the poster girl for Pears, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product. Modern advertising originated with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays, considered the founder of modern, "Madison Avenue" advertising.
Worldwide spending on advertising in 2015 amounted to an estimated US$529.43 billion. Advertising's projected distribution for 2017 was 40.4% on TV, 33.3% on digital, 9% on newspapers, 6.9% on magazines, 5.8% on outdoor, and 4.3% on radio. Internationally, the largest ("Big Five") advertising agency groups are Omnicom, WPP, Publicis, Interpublic, and Dentsu.
In Latin, advertere means "to turn towards".
> Thought 2: From the search results, I understand that advertising is a practice that aims to bring attention to a product or service. It often seeks to generate increased consumption through branding and can also be used for non-commercial purposes. The claim states that advertising is a personal message, but the definition provided does not specifically mention that it is a personal message. I need to look up the definition of a personal message to compare it with the definition of advertising.
OK.
> Lookup[personal message]
No Results
> Thought 3: Since the lookup for "personal message" did not return any results, I should consider the general understanding of a personal message. A personal message is typically a communication intended for a specific individual or a small group of individuals, often conveying a personal or emotional message. Given the definition of advertising as a practice to bring attention to a product or service, it is not necessarily a personal message. Advertising is generally aimed at a broader audience rather than a specific individual.
OK.
> Thought 4: Based on the definition of advertising and the general understanding of a personal message, it appears that advertising is not inherently a personal message. Advertising is more about reaching a wide audience and promoting products or services, rather than being a personal communication. Therefore, the claim that "Advertising is a personal message" does not seem to be supported by the information provided.
OK.

> Thought 2: Since the search did not return the exact entity, I will look for information about Jennifer Lopez's music career, focusing on whether she made a single. I will try to find a page that mentions her discography or singles.
OK.
> Search[Jennifer Lopez discography]
American singer Jennifer Lopez has released nine studio albums, one remix album, three compilation albums, one soundtrack, one extended play, 66 singles (including 14 as a featured artist), five charity singles and 13 promotional singles. As of 2022, the singer has sold more than 80 million records with 15 billion streams worldwide. She made her chart debut in May 1999 with "If You Had My Love", which topped the charts in six countries, including the United States. It was followed by the release of her debut studio album, On the 6 (1999), which reached the top five in several countries and produced four additional singles, including the international hit "Waiting for Tonight". The simultaneous release of her second studio album, J.Lo, and the film, The Wedding Planner, in January 2001, made Lopez the first entertainer to have a number one film and album in the United States in the same week. The album was certified four-times platinum in the United States and yielded four hit singles, including "Love Don't Cost a Thing" and "I'm Real", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The following year saw the release of Lopez's remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes (2002), which became the first remix album in history to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, and went on to become one of the best selling remix albums of all time. Three singles were released from the album, including "Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks.
Lopez's third studio album, This Is Me... Then (2002), reached number two on the Billboard 200, and earned double-platinum status in the United States. Four singles were released from the album, including the hits "Jenny from the Block" and "All I Have", which topped the charts in the United States and New Zealand. Her fourth studio album, Rebirth (2005), charted moderately in the United States, eventually earning a platinum certification. It produced two singles, including its lead single, "Get Right", which went number one in five countries. Lopez's first full-length Spanish album, Como Ama una Mujer, was released in March 2007 and peaked at number ten on the US Billboard 200. Two singles were released from the album, most notably "Qué Hiciste", which was an international success and was certified eight-times platinum in Spain. A little over six months later, the singer released her sixth studio album, Brave (2007), which became her first album to miss the top ten on the Billboard 200. Just like the album, its lead single, "Do It Well", was only a moderate success.
Following a move to Island Records from Sony Music, Lopez released her seventh studio album, Love?, in May 2011, which was a moderately successful, but brief, comeback for her. Three singles were released from the album, including "On the Floor", which became the singer's most successful single in her career. The song topped more than eighteen national charts and sold more than 8.4 million digital copies globally, making it the best-selling single of 2011 by a female artist. Lopez's first greatest hits album, Dance Again... the Hits (2012), followed a year later and produced the international hit "Dance Again". Her eighth studio album, A.K.A., was released in June 2014 by Capitol Records and became her lowest-selling album in the US. Three singles were released from the album, including "Booty", which reached the top 20 in Canada and the United States. After A.K.A.'s underperformance, Lopez then departed from the label and returned to Epic Records. Instead of releasing studio albums, she released several standalone singles such as "Ain't Your Mama", "Dinero" and "Pa' Ti". In 2022, in collaboration with Maluma, she released a movie soundtrack. In 2024, she released a sequel album to This Is Me... Then entitled This Is Me... Now, her first studio album in a decade.
> Thought 3: The observation clearly states that Jennifer Lopez has released 66 singles (including 14 as a featured artist). This confirms that she has indeed made a single.

Claim: Juventus F.C. rejected their traditional black-and-white-striped home uniform in 1903.

>

2025-04-19 21:08:51 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about Juventus F.C. and their uniform history, specifically focusing on whether they rejected their traditional black-and-white-striped home uniform in 1903.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:08:57 - Act 2: Search[Juventus F.C.]
Obs 2: Juventus Football Club (from Latin: iuventūs, 'youth'; Italian pronunciation: [juˈvɛntus]), commonly known as Juventus or colloquially as Juve (pronounced [ˈjuːve]), is an Italian professional football club based in Turin, Piedmont, who compete in Serie A, the top tier of the Italian football league system. Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club played in different grounds around the city, and plays now in Juventus Stadium.
Nicknamed la Vecchia Signora ("the Old Lady"), it has won 36 official league titles, 15 Coppa Italia trophies and nine Italian Super Cups, being the record holder for all these competitions; they also hold two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cup / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, three UEFA Cups (Italian record), two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup (Italian record). Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification, whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies, as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking, having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.
Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club, it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006–07 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923. The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs ante litteram in the country, having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s, and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s, being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.
Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international tournaments, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976–77 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983–84 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984–85 European Champions' Cup. With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies; an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi, becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association. In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world, and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.
The club's fan base is the largest at the national level and one of the largest worldwide. Unlike most European sporting supporters' groups, which are often concentrated around their own club's city of origin, it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of anticampanilismo ("anti-parochialism") and italianità ("Italianness"). Juventus players have won eight Ballon d'Or awards, four of these in consecutive years (1982–1985, an overall joint record), among these Michel Platini as well as three of the five recipients with Italian nationality as the first player representing Serie A, Omar Sívori, and the former member of the youth sector Paolo Rossi; they have also won four FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners as Roberto Baggio and Zinedine Zidane, a national record and third and joint second highest overall, respectively, in the cited prizes. Finally, the club has also provided the most players to the Italy national team—mostly in official competitions in almost uninterrupted way since 1924—who often formed the group that led the Azzurri squad to international success, most importantly in the 1934, 1982 and 2006 FIFA World Cups.

The following evening, the Family murdered supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, at their home in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles.
On the night of August 8–9, four members of the Family – Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Linda Kasabian – drove from Spahn Ranch to 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, the home Tate shared with her husband, film director Roman Polanski. The group murdered Tate (who was 8½ months pregnant), and guests Sebring, a celebrity hairdresser; Folger, heiress to the Folgers coffee fortune; her boyfriend Frykowski, an aspiring screenwriter; and Parent, an 18-year-old visiting the guest house caretaker. Polanski was not home as he was working on a film in Europe. Manson was a cult leader and wannabe musician who had tried to get a contract with record producer Terry Melcher, who had previously rented the house.
The following night, the four participants in the Cielo Drive killings, in addition to Manson, Leslie Van Houten and Steve "Clem" Grogan, committed two more murders. Manson had allegedly said he would show them how to do it. Linda Kasabian drove the group to 3301 Waverly Drive.: 22–25, 42–48  Manson left with Atkins, Grogan and Kasabian in the car and told the others to hitchhike back to the ranch. Watson, Krenwinkel and Van Houten killed the couple in the early morning hours of August 10.

Charles Milles Manson (né Maddox; November 12, 1934 – November 19, 2017) was an American criminal, cult leader, and musician who led the Manson Family, a cult based in California in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some cult members committed a series of at least nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969. In 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, including the film actress Sharon Tate. The prosecution contended that, while Manson never directly ordered the murders, his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy.
Before the murders, Manson had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions. While gathering his cult following, he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry, chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, who introduced Manson to record producer Terry Melcher. In 1968, the Beach Boys recorded Manson's song "Cease to Exist", renamed "Never Learn Not to Love" as a single B-side, but Manson was uncredited. Afterward, he attempted to secure a record contract through Melcher, but was unsuccessful.
Manson would often talk about the Beatles, including their eponymous 1968 album. According to Los Angeles County District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi, Manson felt guided by his interpretation of the Beatles' lyrics and adopted the term "Helter Skelter" to describe an impending apocalyptic race war. During his trial, Bugliosi argued that Manson had intended to start a race war, although Manson and others disputed this. Contemporary interviews and trial witness testimony insisted that the Tate–LaBianca murders were copycat crimes intended to exonerate Manson's friend Bobby Beausoleil. Manson himself denied having ordered any murders. Nevertheless, he served his time in prison and died from complications from colon cancer in 2017.
> Thought 5: The information provided in the last search indicates that Charles Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, including Sharon Tate. This suggests that he has been proven guilty, not innocent, of the crimes he was charged with. Therefore, the claim that Charles Manson has been proven innocent of all crimes is false.
OK.

By 1996, she had won the "Top Newcomer" award from each of the three major adult movie organizations. She has since won more than 35 adult-video awards, and has been inducted into the X-Rated Critics Organization (XRCO) and Adult Video News (AVN) Halls of Fame.
Jameson founded the adult-entertainment company ClubJenna in 2000 with Jay Grdina, whom she later married and divorced. Initially, a single website, this business expanded into managing similar websites of other stars and began producing sexually explicit videos in 2001. The first such movie, Briana Loves Jenna (with Briana Banks), was named at the 2003 AVN Awards as the best-selling and best-renting pornographic title for 2002. By 2005, ClubJenna had revenues of US$30 million with profits estimated at half that.
Jameson has also crossed over into mainstream pop culture, starting with a minor role in Howard Stern's 1997 film Private Parts. Her mainstream appearances continued with several guest-hosting and guest-starring on various television programs. Playboy TV hosted her Jenna's American Sex Star reality show, in which aspiring porn stars competed for a ClubJenna contract. Her 2004 autobiography, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale, spent six weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.
Jameson announced her retirement from pornography at the 2008 AVN Awards, stating that she would never return to the industry. Although she no longer performs in pornographic films, she began working as a webcam model in 2013.
2025-04-19 21:13:24 - Act 13: Thought 7: The observation from the search on "Jenna Jameson career" explicitly states that she started acting in erotic videos in 1993 after having worked as a stripper and glamour model. This directly supports the claim that Jenna Jameson worked as a glamor model and a stripper.

Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:13:50 - Act 2: Search[New Orleans Pelicans]
Obs 2: The New Orleans Pelicans are an American professional basketball team based in New Orleans. The Pelicans compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at Smoothie King Center.
The Pelicans were established as the New Orleans Hornets in the 2002–03 season when George Shinn, then owner of the Charlotte Hornets, relocated the franchise to New Orleans. Due to the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the team temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City, where they spent two seasons as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets before returning to New Orleans for the 2007–08 season. In 2013, the Hornets announced that they would change their name to the New Orleans Pelicans after the 2012–13 season. Since 2014, the NBA officially considers the New Orleans franchise as an expansion team that began play in the 2002–03 NBA season.
In 22 seasons of play since the original franchise relocated from Charlotte, the New Orleans franchise has achieved an overall regular season record of 831–937 (.470) and qualified for the playoffs nine times. Their achievements include two playoff series victories and one division title.
2025-04-19 21:13:53 - Act 3: Thought 2: The search results clearly state that the New Orleans Pelicans compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA), not the National Football Association (NFA). This directly contradicts the claim.

OK.
> Search[Jennifer Lopez discography]
American singer Jennifer Lopez has released nine studio albums, one remix album, three compilation albums, one soundtrack, one extended play, 66 singles (including 14 as a featured artist), five charity singles and 13 promotional singles. As of 2022, the singer has sold more than 80 million records with 15 billion streams worldwide. She made her chart debut in May 1999 with "If You Had My Love", which topped the charts in six countries, including the United States. It was followed by the release of her debut studio album, On the 6 (1999), which reached the top five in several countries and produced four additional singles, including the international hit "Waiting for Tonight". The simultaneous release of her second studio album, J.Lo, and the film, The Wedding Planner, in January 2001, made Lopez the first entertainer to have a number one film and album in the United States in the same week. The album was certified four-times platinum in the United States and yielded four hit singles, including "Love Don't Cost a Thing" and "I'm Real", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The following year saw the release of Lopez's remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes (2002), which became the first remix album in history to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, and went on to become one of the best selling remix albums of all time. Three singles were released from the album, including "Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks.
Lopez's third studio album, This Is Me... Then (2002), reached number two on the Billboard 200, and earned double-platinum status in the United States. Four singles were released from the album, including the hits "Jenny from the Block" and "All I Have", which topped the charts in the United States and New Zealand. Her fourth studio album, Rebirth (2005), charted moderately in the United States, eventually earning a platinum certification. It produced two singles, including its lead single, "Get Right", which went number one in five countries. Lopez's first full-length Spanish album, Como Ama una Mujer, was released in March 2007 and peaked at number ten on the US Billboard 200. Two singles were released from the album, most notably "Qué Hiciste", which was an international success and was certified eight-times platinum in Spain. A little over six months later, the singer released her sixth studio album, Brave (2007), which became her first album to miss the top ten on the Billboard 200. Just like the album, its lead single, "Do It Well", was only a moderate success.
Following a move to Island Records from Sony Music, Lopez released her seventh studio album, Love?, in May 2011, which was a moderately successful, but brief, comeback for her. Three singles were released from the album, including "On the Floor", which became the singer's most successful single in her career. The song topped more than eighteen national charts and sold more than 8.4 million digital copies globally, making it the best-selling single of 2011 by a female artist. Lopez's first greatest hits album, Dance Again... the Hits (2012), followed a year later and produced the international hit "Dance Again". Her eighth studio album, A.K.A., was released in June 2014 by Capitol Records and became her lowest-selling album in the US. Three singles were released from the album, including "Booty", which reached the top 20 in Canada and the United States. After A.K.A.'s underperformance, Lopez then departed from the label and returned to Epic Records. Instead of releasing studio albums, she released several standalone singles such as "Ain't Your Mama", "Dinero" and "Pa' Ti". In 2022, in collaboration with Maluma, she released a movie soundtrack. In 2024, she released a sequel album to This Is Me... Then entitled This Is Me... Now, her first studio album in a decade.

Claim: Caroline Kennedy is a Catholic.

>

2025-04-19 21:14:10 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about Caroline Kennedy's religious affiliation.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:14:15 - Act 2: Search[Caroline Kennedy]
Obs 2: Caroline Bouvier Kennedy (born November 27, 1957) is an American author, diplomat, and attorney who served as the United States ambassador to Australia from 2022 to 2024. She previously served in the Obama administration as the United States ambassador to Japan from 2013 to 2017. Most of Kennedy's professional life has been in literature, law, politics, education reform, and charity. She is a member of the Kennedy family and the only surviving child of US president John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. 
Born in New York City, Kennedy was two years old when her father won the 1960 presidential election and spent her early childhood years in the White House during his presidency. Kennedy was only five years old when he was assassinated on November 22, 1963. The following year, she and her younger brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., moved with their mother Jacqueline to the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where Kennedy continued her education. Kennedy graduated from Radcliffe College of Harvard University and later attended Columbia Law School, where she earned a Juris Doctor degree in 1988. Kennedy passed the New York State bar exam the following year. She worked at Manhattan's Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she met her future husband, designer Edwin Schlossberg. They have three children: Rose, Tatiana, and Jack.
Early in the primary race for the 2008 presidential election, Kennedy and her uncle, Ted Kennedy, endorsed Democratic candidate Barack Obama. She later stumped for him in Florida, Indiana, and Ohio, served as co-chair of his Vice Presidential Search Committee, and addressed the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. After Obama selected United States senator Hillary Clinton to serve as secretary of state, Kennedy expressed interest in being appointed to Clinton's vacant Senate seat from New York, but later withdrew citing personal reasons. In 2013, President Obama appointed Kennedy as the United States ambassador to Japan making her the first female ambassador to serve in the country. Eight years later, Joe Biden appointed Kennedy as United States ambassador to Australia and she took office following her confirmation on June 10, 2022.
2025-04-19 21:14:17 - Act 3: Thought 2: The observation does not mention Caroline Kennedy's religious affiliation. I need to look up information specifically about her religious beliefs or background.

2025-04-19 21:14:22 - Act 5: Thought 3: Since the search for "Catholic" did not yield any results, I should look for more specific information about Caroline Kennedy's religious background. Given that she is from a prominent Catholic family, it might be mentioned in her family's context or her personal background.
Obs 5: OK.
2025-04-19 21:14:23 - Act 6: Lookup[Kennedy family religion]
Obs 6: No Results
2025-04-19 21:14:26 - Act 7: Thought 4: Since the searches for "Catholic" and "Kennedy family religion" did not yield any results, I should consider if there is any indirect information that might suggest her religious affiliation. Given that Caroline Kennedy is from a prominent Catholic family, it is likely that she is Catholic, but I need to find a direct statement or reference to confirm this.
Obs 7: OK.
2025-04-19 21:14:30 - Act 8: Thought 5: Since direct searches for her religious affiliation did not yield results, I should consider looking for information about her family's religious background and any public statements she has made regarding her faith. Given that she is from a prominent Catholic family, it is likely that she is Catholic, but I need to find a direct statement or reference to confirm this.
Obs 8: OK.

I will look for any mentions of her attending Catholic schools or participating in Catholic events.
Obs 10: OK.

2025-04-19 21:14:40 - Act 12: Thought 7: Since direct searches for her religious affiliation did not yield results, and looking for indirect information also did not provide any results, I should consider the context and background of the claim. Given that Caroline Kennedy is from a prominent Catholic family and her mother was the First Lady of the United States, it is highly likely that she is Catholic. However, without a direct statement or reference confirming her religious affiliation, I cannot definitively support or refute the claim.
Obs 12: OK.
2025-04-19 21:14:44 - Act 13: Thought 8: Given the lack of direct information about Caroline Kennedy's religious affiliation, I should consider the context and background of the claim. While it is highly likely that she is Catholic due to her family's background, I need to be cautious and ensure that the claim is supported by a direct statement or reference. Since I cannot find any direct information, I should conclude that there is not enough information to support or refute the claim.

Use the above examples and insights as a foundation, and now work on the following task:
Claim: Starrcade was an annual professional wrestling event that began in 1988.

>

2025-04-19 21:15:02 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about Starrcade and specifically check if it began in 1988.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:15:07 - Act 2: Search[Starrcade]
Obs 2: Starrcade was a recurring professional wrestling event, originally broadcast via closed-circuit television and eventually broadcast via pay-per-view. It was originally held from 1983 to 2000, first by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) from 1983 to 1990, with the 1983–1987 events specifically held by Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) under the NWA, and then held by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from 1988 to 2000.
Starrcade was regarded by the NWA and WCW as their flagship event of the year, much in the same vein that its rival, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), regarded WrestleMania. As a result, the buildup to each Starrcade featured the largest feuds of the promotion. In 2001, the WWF acquired WCW, and the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2002.
WWE revived the event in 2017 as a house show with portions of the events in 2018 and 2019 airing as WWE Network specials. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an event was not held in 2020 and no further events were scheduled.
2025-04-19 21:15:11 - Act 3: Thought 2: The search result mentions that Starrcade was originally held from 1983 to 2000, with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) holding events from 1983 to 1987 under the NWA. It also states that WCW held the event from 1988 to 2000. This indicates that Starrcade began in 1983, not 1988 as the claim suggests.
Obs 3: OK.

> Thought 4: Since searching for Edgar Wright still did not return the exact entity, I should try to find information about him through the similar entities provided. The most relevant entities are 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Baby Driver', and 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World', as these are films directed by Edgar Wright.
OK.
> Search[Shaun of the Dead]
Shaun of the Dead is a 2004 zombie comedy film directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg. Pegg stars as Shaun, a downtrodden London salesman who is caught alongside his loved ones in a zombie apocalypse. It also stars Nick Frost in his film debut, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, and Penelope Wilton. It is the first film in Wright and Pegg's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, followed by Hot Fuzz (2007) and The World's End (2013).
Shaun of the Dead was inspired by ideas Pegg and Wright used for their 1999-2001 television sitcom Spaced, particularly an episode in which Pegg's character hallucinates a zombie invasion. The film references the Night of the Living Dead films by George A. Romero. Principal photography took place across London and at Ealing Studios for nine weeks between May and June 2003.
Shaun of the Dead premiered in London on 29 March 2004, before it was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2004 and in the United States on 24 September. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing $38.7 million worldwide on a budget of $6.1 million and receiving two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards. It was ranked third on the Channel 4 list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films and quickly acquired a cult following. In film studies, it is seen as a product of post-9/11 anxiety and a model for transnational comedy, while the zombie outbreak as depicted in the film has been used as a modelling example for disease control.
> Thought 5: Since the information about "Shaun of the Dead" confirms that Edgar Wright directed this film, it supports the claim that Edgar Wright is a person, specifically a film director.
OK.

Claim: Steve Wozniak was born after the Apple II came out.

2025-04-19 21:17:59 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about Steve Wozniak and the release date of the Apple II to determine if he was born after it came out.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:18:04 - Act 2: Search[Steve Wozniak]
Obs 2: Stephen Gary Wozniak (; born August 11, 1950), also known by his nickname Woz, is an American technology entrepreneur, electrical engineer, computer programmer, philanthropist, and inventor. In 1976, he co-founded Apple Computer with his early business partner Steve Jobs. Through his work at Apple in the 1970s and 1980s, he is widely recognized as one of the most prominent pioneers of the personal computer revolution.
In 1975, Wozniak started developing the Apple I: 150  into the computer that launched Apple when he and Jobs first began marketing it the following year. He was the primary designer of the Apple II, introduced in 1977, known as one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers, while Jobs oversaw the development of its foam-molded plastic case and early Apple employee Rod Holt developed its switching power supply. 
With human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin, Wozniak had a major influence over the initial development of the original  Macintosh concepts from 1979 to 1981, when Jobs took over the project following Wozniak's brief departure from the company due to a traumatic airplane accident. After permanently leaving Apple in 1985, Wozniak founded CL 9 and created the first programmable universal remote, released in 1987. He then pursued several other businesses and philanthropic ventures throughout his career, focusing largely on technology in K–12 schools.
As of June 2024, Wozniak has remained an employee of Apple in a ceremonial capacity since stepping down in 1985. In recent years, he has helped fund multiple entrepreneurial efforts dealing in areas such as GPS and telecommunications, flash memory, technology and pop culture conventions, technical education, ecology, satellites and more.
2025-04-19 21:18:06 - Act 3: Thought 2: From the search result, I know that the Apple II was introduced in 1977. Now, I need to find out when Steve Wozniak was born to compare the dates.

Obs 4: OK.
2025-04-19 21:18:14 - Act 5: Thought 3: The search result for Steve Wozniak mentions that he was born on August 11, 1950. Now, I need to compare this birth year with the release year of the Apple II to determine if the claim is true.
Obs 5: OK.
2025-04-19 21:18:16 - Act 6: Thought 4: Since Steve Wozniak was born in 1950 and the Apple II was introduced in 1977, it is clear that Wozniak was born before the Apple II came out.

It provides content nationally with programming syndicated worldwide to more than 100 countries in over 35 languages.
The network was founded in 1984 as NetSpan before being renamed Telemundo in 1987 after the branding used on WKAQ-TV, its owned-and-operated station in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1997, Liberty Media and Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired controlling interest in Telemundo. NBC then purchased Telemundo in 2001.
The channel broadcasts programs and original content aimed at Latin American audiences in the United States and worldwide, consisting of telenovelas, sports, reality television, news programming and films—either imported or Spanish-dubbed. In addition, Telemundo operates Universo, a separate channel directed towards young Hispanic audiences; Telemundo Digital Media, which distributes original programming content across mass media, the Telemundo and Universo websites; Puerto Rico free-to-air station WKAQ-TV; and international distribution arm Telemundo Internacional.
Telemundo is headquartered in Miami and operates a studio and productions facility in the Miami suburb of Doral, Florida, and has 1,900 employees worldwide. The majority of Telemundo's programs are shot at an operated studio facility in Miami, where 85 percent of the network's telenovelas were recorded during 2011.

Obs 4: A&E, an initialism of its original name (the Arts & Entertainment Network), is an American cable and satellite television network and the flagship property of A&E Networks, a joint venture between Hearst Communications and the Walt Disney Company (through the Disney General Entertainment Content division of Disney Entertainment). A&E was launched on February 1, 1984, as a block on Nickelodeon. The network originally focused on fine arts, documentaries, dramas, and educational entertainment. Today, it deals primarily in non-fiction programming, including reality television, true crime, documentaries and miniseries, thus de-emphasizing its full name in the process. 
Since 1985, it is no longer a programming block, due to its joint owners spinning it off into a 24-hour channel while Nickelodeon later launched Nick at Nite to fill in the time slot A&E formerly held. As of November 2023, A&E is available to approximately 63,000,000 pay television households in the United States – down from its 2011 peak of 100,000,000 households. The American version of the channel is being distributed in Canada while international versions were launched for Australia, Latin America, and Europe.

The most relevant entities are 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Baby Driver', and 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World', as these are films directed by Edgar Wright.
OK.
> Search[Shaun of the Dead]
Shaun of the Dead is a 2004 zombie comedy film directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg. Pegg stars as Shaun, a downtrodden London salesman who is caught alongside his loved ones in a zombie apocalypse. It also stars Nick Frost in his film debut, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, and Penelope Wilton. It is the first film in Wright and Pegg's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, followed by Hot Fuzz (2007) and The World's End (2013).
Shaun of the Dead was inspired by ideas Pegg and Wright used for their 1999-2001 television sitcom Spaced, particularly an episode in which Pegg's character hallucinates a zombie invasion. The film references the Night of the Living Dead films by George A. Romero. Principal photography took place across London and at Ealing Studios for nine weeks between May and June 2003.
Shaun of the Dead premiered in London on 29 March 2004, before it was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2004 and in the United States on 24 September. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing $38.7 million worldwide on a budget of $6.1 million and receiving two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards. It was ranked third on the Channel 4 list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films and quickly acquired a cult following. In film studies, it is seen as a product of post-9/11 anxiety and a model for transnational comedy, while the zombie outbreak as depicted in the film has been used as a modelling example for disease control.
> Thought 5: Since the information about "Shaun of the Dead" confirms that Edgar Wright directed this film, it supports the claim that Edgar Wright is a person, specifically a film director.
OK.

To date, Trump has been portrayed on SNL by performers including Shane Gillis, Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond, Jason Sudeikis, Taran Killam, Alec Baldwin and James Austin Johnson. Hammond portrayed him the longest while in the cast in the late 1990s, and then reprising the role in a series of cameos in 2016. The other cast-members held the role briefly, with five appearances by Hartman, three by Killam, and only one by Sudeikis. The role was played by Baldwin in 46 recurring guest appearances along with one hosting appearance between October 2016 and November 2020, just ahead of the 2016 presidential election, and throughout the first Trump presidency. Johnson took over the role in November 2021, after Trump left the White House, while Shane Gillis portrayed Trump in the skit "Trump Sneakers," with a supporting appearance by Johnson.

Jenna Marie Massoli (born April 9, 1974), known professionally as Jenna Jameson (), is an American businesswoman, writer, television personality, and former pornographic film actress. She has been named the world's most famous adult entertainment performer and "The Queen of Porn".
Jameson started acting in erotic videos in 1993 after having worked as a stripper and glamour model. By 1996, she had won the "Top Newcomer" award from each of the three major adult movie organizations. She has since won more than 35 adult-video awards, and has been inducted into the X-Rated Critics Organization (XRCO) and Adult Video News (AVN) Halls of Fame.
Jameson founded the adult-entertainment company ClubJenna in 2000 with Jay Grdina, whom she later married and divorced. Initially, a single website, this business expanded into managing similar websites of other stars and began producing sexually explicit videos in 2001. The first such movie, Briana Loves Jenna (with Briana Banks), was named at the 2003 AVN Awards as the best-selling and best-renting pornographic title for 2002. By 2005, ClubJenna had revenues of US$30 million with profits estimated at half that.
Jameson has also crossed over into mainstream pop culture, starting with a minor role in Howard Stern's 1997 film Private Parts. Her mainstream appearances continued with several guest-hosting and guest-starring on various television programs. Playboy TV hosted her Jenna's American Sex Star reality show, in which aspiring porn stars competed for a ClubJenna contract. Her 2004 autobiography, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale, spent six weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.
Jameson announced her retirement from pornography at the 2008 AVN Awards, stating that she would never return to the industry. Although she no longer performs in pornographic films, she began working as a webcam model in 2013.
> Thought 7: The observation from the search on "Jenna Jameson career" explicitly states that she started acting in erotic videos in 1993 after having worked as a stripper and glamour model. This directly supports the claim that Jenna Jameson worked as a glamor model and a stripper.
OK.

Claim: XHamster's The Sex Factor forces eight men and eight women to battle to become a porn star.

2025-04-19 21:24:09 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for "XHamster's The Sex Factor" to find information about the show and its format.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:24:14 - Act 2: Search[XHamster's The Sex Factor]
Obs 2: xHamster, stylized as XHAMSTER, is a pornographic video sharing and streaming website, based in Limassol, Cyprus. xHamster serves user-submitted pornographic videos, webcam models, pornographic photographs, and erotic literature, and incorporates social networking features. xHamster was founded in 2007. As of August 2024, it is the 33rd-most-visited website in the world, and the third-most-visited adult website, after Pornhub and XVideos.
The site produced The Sex Factor, a reality TV series in which contestants compete to become porn stars and OnlyFans stars. The site has been targeted as part of malvertising campaigns, and some governments have blocked xHamster as part of larger initiatives against internet pornography.
2025-04-19 21:24:16 - Act 3: Thought 2: The search did not provide information about the specific format of "XHamster's The Sex Factor." I need to look up more specific details about the show to find information about the number of contestants and their roles.
Obs 3: OK.
2025-04-19 21:24:19 - Act 4: Lookup[The Sex Factor contestants]

2025-04-19 21:24:21 - Act 5: Thought 3: Since the search for "The Sex Factor contestants" did not yield any results, I need to look up more specific details about the show's format to find information about the number of contestants and their roles.

2025-04-19 21:24:30 - Act 8: Search[XHamster's The Sex Factor format]
Obs 8: Could not find [XHamster's The Sex Factor format]. Similar: []
2025-04-19 21:24:34 - Act 9: Thought 5: The search for "XHamster's The Sex Factor format" did not yield any results, which suggests that the specific format of the show might not be widely documented or available. However, based on the information provided, I can infer that the show is a reality TV series where contestants compete to become porn stars and OnlyFans stars. I need to find more specific details about the number of contestants and their roles.
Obs 9: OK.
2025-04-19 21:24:38 - Act 10: Thought 6: Since the searches did not provide specific details about the number of contestants and their roles, I will look up "The Sex Factor contestants" again, using a different approach to find more relevant information.
Obs 10: OK.
2025-04-19 21:24:39 - Act 11: Lookup[The Sex Factor contestants]
Obs 11: The last page Searched was not found, so you cannot Lookup a keyword in it. Please try one of the similar pages given.
2025-04-19 21:24:42 - Act 12: Thought 7: Since the previous searches did not provide the specific information about the number of contestants and their roles, I will try to find more relevant information by looking up "The Sex Factor contestants" again, but this time focusing on the show's format and rules to infer the number of contestants and their roles.
Obs 12: OK.
2025-04-19 21:24:46 - Act 13: Thought 8: Since the previous searches did not provide the specific information about the number of contestants and their roles, I will try to find more relevant information by looking up "The Sex Factor contestants" again, but this time focusing on the show's format and rules to infer the number of contestants and their roles. I will also consider the context of reality TV shows and the typical format of such competitions.
Obs 13: OK.
2025-04-19 21:24:51 - Act 14: Thought 9: Given that the searches for "XHamster's The Sex Factor format" and "The Sex Factor contestants" did not yield specific results, I will try to find more context about reality TV shows and their typical formats to infer the number of contestants and their roles. Reality TV shows often have a set number of contestants, and the claim states "eight men and eight women," which is a common format for such competitions.
Obs 14: OK.
2025-04-19 21:24:56 - Act 15: Thought 10: Based on the context of reality TV shows and the typical format of such competitions, it is reasonable to infer that "XHamster's The Sex Factor" likely has eight men and eight women as contestants. However, to be certain, I should consider the possibility that the show might have a different format or that the claim might be incorrect. I will look up more general information about reality TV show formats to confirm this.

## Your Own Past Successes (Execution Patterns)
Here are examples of successful execution processes you've previously used on similar tasks.  
Pay special attention to the step-by-step procedures and strategies, especially when encountering obstacles:

Task 1:

### Task description:   
Claim: Harold Macmillan was born on February 20, 1894.
- Environment feedback
You successfully finished this task.
    

### Key steps:
Search for Harold Macmillan: Look up information about Harold Macmillan.
Find Birth Date: Discover that Harold Macmillan was born on February 26, 1894.
Compare with Claim: Notice that the birth date found (February 26, 1894) does not match the claim (February 20, 1894).
Conclude: The claim is incorrect as the birth date found contradicts the claim.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Harold Macmillan and find his birth date.
OK.
> Search[Harold Macmillan]
Maurice Harold Macmillan, 1st Earl of Stockton (10 February 1894 – 29 December 1986) was a British statesman and Conservative politician who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1957 to 1963. Nicknamed "Supermac", he was known for his pragmatism, wit, and unflappability.
Macmillan was seriously injured as an infantry officer during the First World War. He suffered pain and partial immobility for the rest of his life. After the war he joined his family book-publishing business, then entered Parliament at the 1924 general election for Stockton-on-Tees. Losing his seat in 1929, he regained it in 1931, soon after which he spoke out against the high rate of unemployment in Stockton. He opposed the appeasement of Germany practised by the Conservative government. He rose to high office during the Second World War as a protégé of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In the 1950s Macmillan served as Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer under Anthony Eden.
When Eden resigned in 1957 following the Suez Crisis, Macmillan succeeded him as prime minister and Leader of the Conservative Party. He was a One Nation Tory of the Disraelian tradition and supported the post-war consensus. He supported the welfare state and the necessity of a mixed economy with some nationalised industries and strong trade unions. He championed a Keynesian strategy of deficit spending to maintain demand and pursuit of corporatist policies to develop the domestic market as the engine of growth. Benefiting from favourable international conditions, he presided over an age of affluence, marked by low unemployment and high—if uneven—growth. In his speech of July 1957 he told the nation it had "never had it so good", but warned of the dangers of inflation, summing up the fragile prosperity of the 1950s. He led the Conservatives to success in 1959 with an increased majority.
In international affairs, Macmillan worked to rebuild the Special Relationship with the United States from the wreckage of the 1956 Suez Crisis (of which he had been one of the architects), and facilitated the decolonisation of Africa. Reconfiguring the nation's defences to meet the realities of the nuclear age, he ended National Service, strengthened the nuclear forces by acquiring Polaris, and pioneered the Nuclear Test Ban with the United States and the Soviet Union. After the Skybolt Crisis undermined the Anglo-American strategic relationship, he sought a more active role for Britain in Europe, but his unwillingness to disclose United States nuclear secrets to France contributed to a French veto of the United Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community and independent French acquisition of nuclear weapons in 1960. Near the end of his premiership, his government was rocked by the Vassall Tribunal and the Profumo affair, which to cultural conservatives and supporters of opposing parties alike seemed to symbolise moral decay of the British establishment. Following his resignation, Macmillan lived out a long retirement as an elder statesman, being an active member of the House of Lords in his final years. He died in December 1986 at the age of 92.
> Thought 2: The observation states that Harold Macmillan was born on 10 February 1894, not 20 February 1894 as claimed. This directly contradicts the claim.
OK.

Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:28:16 - Act 2: Search[Despicable Me 2]
Obs 2: Despicable Me 2 is a 2013 American animated comedy film produced by Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment, and distributed by Universal. It is the sequel to Despicable Me (2010) and the second installment in the Despicable Me franchise. The film was directed by Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin, produced by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy, and written by the writing team of Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio. It stars the voices of Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Benjamin Bratt, Miranda Cosgrove, Russell Brand, Steve Coogan, and Ken Jeong. In the film, secret agent Lucy Wilde recruits retired supervillain Gru to investigate the theft of a powerful mutagen by El Macho, a supervillain who pursues world domination.
Development of Despicable Me 2 began in 2010 following the success of the original film, with the directors, producers, and writers returning. Production was underway by February 2012, with the majority of the cast returning to voice the characters, along with new cast members, while animation services were provided by Illumination Mac Guff in France. Al Pacino was cast as the voice of El Macho, recording all of his dialogue, but left in May 2013 over creative differences; Bratt was brought in to replace Pacino, and used him as an inspiration after finding imitating his voice impossible. Heitor Pereira and Pharrell Williams returned for the sequel's music.
Despicable Me 2 premiered in Australia on June 5, 2013, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 3. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its humor and animation. It earned $971 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2013 and the most profitable film for Universal Pictures at the time. It was nominated for two awards at the 86th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades. A sequel, Despicable Me 3, was released in 2017.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Mogadishu to find information about its status as a capital.
OK.
> Search[Mogadishu]
Mogadishu, locally known as Xamar or Hamar, is the capital and most populous city of Somalia. The city has served as an important port connecting traders across the Indian Ocean for millennia and has an estimated urban population of 2,610,483.
Mogadishu is located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean, which, unlike other Somali regions, is considered a municipality rather than a maamul goboleed (federal state).
Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade and eventually came under the Ajuran Sultanate in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry. In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate. In the 19th century, it came under the Sultanate of the Geledi's sphere of influence.
In 1894, the Somali chief signed a treaty of peace, friendship, and protection with Filonardi of the Commercial Company of Benadir. The onset of Italian colonial rule occurred in stages, with treaties signed in the 1880s followed by economic engagement between Somali clans and the Commercial Company of Benadir, and then direct governance by the Italian Empire after 1906, British Military Administration of Somalia after World War II and the Trust Territory of Somaliland administered by Italy in the 1950s.
This was followed by independence in 1960, the Somali Democratic Republic era during Siad Barre's presidency (1969–1991). The three-decade long Somali Civil War afterwards devastated the city. As of the late 2010s and 2020s, a period of major reconstruction commenced.

Obs 2: Sikhism ( SEEK-iz-əm) also known as Sikhi, is an Indian religion and philosophy that originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent around the end of the 15th century CE. It is one of the most recently founded major religions and among the largest in the world with about 25–30 million adherents, known as Sikhs.
Sikhism developed from the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak (1469–1539), the faith's first guru, and the nine Sikh gurus who succeeded him. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh (1666–1708), named the Guru Granth Sahib, which is the central religious scripture in Sikhism, as his successor. This brought the line of human gurus to a close. Sikhs regard the Guru Granth Sahib as the 11th and eternally living guru.
The core beliefs and practices of Sikhism, articulated in the Guru Granth Sahib and other Sikh scriptures, include faith and meditation in the name of the one creator (Ik Onkar), the divine unity and equality of all humankind, engaging in selfless service to others (sevā), striving for justice for the benefit and prosperity of all (sarbat da bhala), and honest conduct and livelihood. Following this standard, Sikhism rejects claims that any particular religious tradition has a monopoly on absolute truth. As a consequence, Sikhs do not actively proselytize, although voluntary converts are generally accepted. Sikhism emphasizes meditation and remembrance as a means to feel God's presence (simran), which can be expressed musically through kirtan or internally through naam japna (lit. 'meditation on God's name'). Baptised Sikhs are obliged to wear the five Ks, which are five articles of faith which physically distinguish Sikhs from non-Sikhs. Among these include the kesh (uncut hair). Most religious Sikh men thus do not cut their hair but rather wear a turban.

> Search[Shaun of the Dead]
Shaun of the Dead is a 2004 zombie comedy film directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg. Pegg stars as Shaun, a downtrodden London salesman who is caught alongside his loved ones in a zombie apocalypse. It also stars Nick Frost in his film debut, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, and Penelope Wilton. It is the first film in Wright and Pegg's Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, followed by Hot Fuzz (2007) and The World's End (2013).
Shaun of the Dead was inspired by ideas Pegg and Wright used for their 1999-2001 television sitcom Spaced, particularly an episode in which Pegg's character hallucinates a zombie invasion. The film references the Night of the Living Dead films by George A. Romero. Principal photography took place across London and at Ealing Studios for nine weeks between May and June 2003.
Shaun of the Dead premiered in London on 29 March 2004, before it was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2004 and in the United States on 24 September. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing $38.7 million worldwide on a budget of $6.1 million and receiving two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards. It was ranked third on the Channel 4 list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films and quickly acquired a cult following. In film studies, it is seen as a product of post-9/11 anxiety and a model for transnational comedy, while the zombie outbreak as depicted in the film has been used as a modelling example for disease control.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for "Despicable Me 2" to find information about its director.
OK.
> Search[Despicable Me 2]
Despicable Me 2 is a 2013 American animated comedy film produced by Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment, and distributed by Universal. It is the sequel to Despicable Me (2010) and the second installment in the Despicable Me franchise. The film was directed by Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin, produced by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy, and written by the writing team of Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio. It stars the voices of Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Benjamin Bratt, Miranda Cosgrove, Russell Brand, Steve Coogan, and Ken Jeong. In the film, secret agent Lucy Wilde recruits retired supervillain Gru to investigate the theft of a powerful mutagen by El Macho, a supervillain who pursues world domination.
Development of Despicable Me 2 began in 2010 following the success of the original film, with the directors, producers, and writers returning. Production was underway by February 2012, with the majority of the cast returning to voice the characters, along with new cast members, while animation services were provided by Illumination Mac Guff in France. Al Pacino was cast as the voice of El Macho, recording all of his dialogue, but left in May 2013 over creative differences; Bratt was brought in to replace Pacino, and used him as an inspiration after finding imitating his voice impossible. Heitor Pereira and Pharrell Williams returned for the sequel's music.
Despicable Me 2 premiered in Australia on June 5, 2013, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 3. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its humor and animation. It earned $971 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2013 and the most profitable film for Universal Pictures at the time. It was nominated for two awards at the 86th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades. A sequel, Despicable Me 3, was released in 2017.

### Detailed trajectory:

OK.
> Search[Colin Kaepernick]
Colin Rand Kaepernick ( KAP-ər-nik; born November 3, 1987) is an American civil rights activist and former professional football quarterback. He played six seasons for the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL). In 2016, he gained national attention for kneeling during the national anthem at the start of NFL games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the United States.
Kaepernick played college football for the Nevada Wolf Pack, where he was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Offensive Player of the Year twice and became the only player in NCAA Division I history to amass 10,000 passing yards and 4,000 rushing yards in a career. After graduating, he was selected by the 49ers in the second round of the 2011 NFL draft. Kaepernick began his professional football career as a backup quarterback to Alex Smith, and became the 49ers' starter in the middle of the 2012 season after Smith suffered a concussion. He then remained the team's starting quarterback for the rest of the season, leading the team to their first Super Bowl appearance since 1994. During the 2013 season, his first full season as a starter, Kaepernick helped the 49ers reach the NFC Championship Game. Over the next three seasons, Kaepernick lost and won back his starting quarterback job, with the 49ers missing the playoffs for three seasons.
In the 49ers' third preseason game in 2016, Kaepernick sat during the playing of the U.S. national anthem prior to the game, rather than stand as is customary, as a protest against racial injustice, police brutality and oppression in the country. The following week, and throughout the regular season, Kaepernick kneeled during the anthem. The protests received highly polarized reactions, with some praising his protests and others denouncing the protests. The actions resulted in a wider protest movement, which intensified in September 2017 after President Donald Trump said that NFL owners should "fire" players who protest during the national anthem. Kaepernick became a free agent after the season and remained unsigned, which numerous analysts and observers have attributed to political reasons. In November 2017, he filed a grievance against the NFL and its owners, accusing them of collusion in keeping him out of the league. In August 2018, arbitrator Stephen B. Burbank rejected the NFL's request to dismiss the case. Kaepernick withdrew the grievance in February 2019 after reaching a confidential settlement with the NFL. His protests received renewed attention in 2020 amid the George Floyd protests against police brutality and racism, but he remains unsigned by any professional football team.
> Thought 2: The observation mentions that Kaepernick became the 49ers' starter in the middle of the 2012 season after Alex Smith suffered a concussion. It does not mention the 49ers' 63rd season or any connection to the Republican Party. I need to find more information about the 49ers' 63rd season and any political affiliations.
OK.
> Lookup[49ers 63rd season]
No Results
> Thought 3: Since the direct lookup for the 49ers' 63rd season did not yield results, I should cross-reference the information about the 49ers' seasons and the Republican Party to see if there is any connection. However, the claim specifically mentions the 49ers' 63rd season, which is not a standard term used for NFL seasons. The 49ers have played in the NFL since 1946, and their seasons are typically numbered based on the year they start, not a specific season number. For example, the 2022 season would be the 77th season for the 49ers. The claim might be referring to a specific year or a particular season, but it is not clear from the information provided.
OK.
> Thought 4: Given that the claim mentions the 49ers' 63rd season, it is likely referring to a specific year. However, the information provided does not clarify which year this would be. Additionally, there is no mention of any connection to the Republican Party in the information provided. I need to find more context about the 49ers' seasons and any political affiliations, but the claim is not well-defined.
OK.
> Thought 5: Since the claim is not well-defined and there is no clear reference to the 49ers' 63rd season or any connection to the Republican Party, I need to conclude that there is not enough information to support or refute the claim. The information provided does not clarify the specific year or the connection to the Republican Party, making it impossible to determine the validity of the claim.

Kaepernick began his professional football career as a backup quarterback to Alex Smith, and became the 49ers' starter in the middle of the 2012 season after Smith suffered a concussion. He then remained the team's starting quarterback for the rest of the season, leading the team to their first Super Bowl appearance since 1994. During the 2013 season, his first full season as a starter, Kaepernick helped the 49ers reach the NFC Championship Game. Over the next three seasons, Kaepernick lost and won back his starting quarterback job, with the 49ers missing the playoffs for three seasons.
In the 49ers' third preseason game in 2016, Kaepernick sat during the playing of the U.S. national anthem prior to the game, rather than stand as is customary, as a protest against racial injustice, police brutality and oppression in the country. The following week, and throughout the regular season, Kaepernick kneeled during the anthem. The protests received highly polarized reactions, with some praising his protests and others denouncing the protests. The actions resulted in a wider protest movement, which intensified in September 2017 after President Donald Trump said that NFL owners should "fire" players who protest during the national anthem. Kaepernick became a free agent after the season and remained unsigned, which numerous analysts and observers have attributed to political reasons. In November 2017, he filed a grievance against the NFL and its owners, accusing them of collusion in keeping him out of the league. In August 2018, arbitrator Stephen B. Burbank rejected the NFL's request to dismiss the case. Kaepernick withdrew the grievance in February 2019 after reaching a confidential settlement with the NFL. His protests received renewed attention in 2020 amid the George Floyd protests against police brutality and racism, but he remains unsigned by any professional football team.

Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:34:02 - Act 2: Search[Matteo Renzi]
Obs 2: Matteo Renzi  (pronounced [matˈtɛːo ˈrɛntsi]; born 11 January 1975) is an Italian politician who served as prime minister of Italy from 2014 to 2016. He has been a senator for Florence since 2018. Renzi has served as the leader of Italia Viva (IV) since 2019, having been the secretary of the Democratic Party (PD) from 2013 to 2018, with a brief interruption in 2017.
After serving as the president of the province of Florence from 2004 to 2009 and the mayor of Florence from 2009 to 2014, Renzi was elected secretary of the PD in 2013, becoming prime minister the following year. At the age of 39 years, Renzi, who was at the time the youngest leader in the G7 and also the first-serving mayor to become prime minister, became the youngest person to have served as prime minister. While in power, Renzi's government implemented numerous reforms, including changes to the Italian electoral law, a relaxation of labour and employment laws with the intention of boosting economic growth, a thorough reformation of the public administration, the simplification of civil trials, the introduction of same-sex civil unions, and the abolition of many small taxes.
After the rejection of his constitutional reform in the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum, Renzi formally resigned as prime minister on 12 December; his Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed his replacement. He resigned as secretary of the PD following defeat in the 2018 Italian general election. In September 2019, he left the PD and founded the Italia Viva party. In January 2021, Renzi revoked his party's support to the Conte II Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, which brought down the government and resulted in the 2021 Italian government crisis. In February 2021, Renzi's IV supported Prime Minister Mario Draghi's national unity government. Renzi has been described as a centrist and as a liberal by political observers.

Claim: The Road to El Dorado stars Tim Allen.

2025-04-19 21:34:23 - Act 1: Thought 1: I need to search for "The Road to El Dorado" to find information about the movie and its stars, specifically if Tim Allen is one of them.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:34:28 - Act 2: Search[The Road to El Dorado]
Obs 2: The Road to El Dorado is a 2000 American animated musical adventure comedy film directed by Eric "Bibo" Bergeron and Don Paul, from a screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, as well as additional sequences directed by Will Finn and David Silverman. Starring the voices of Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Rosie Perez, Armand Assante, and Edward James Olmos, the film follows two con artists who, after winning the map to El Dorado in Spain, wash ashore in the New World. The map leads the two men to the city of El Dorado, where its inhabitants mistake them for gods.
The soundtrack features an instrumental score composed by Hans Zimmer and John Powell, and songs written by Elton John and Tim Rice. Elton John also periodically narrates the story in song throughout the film. Produced by DreamWorks Animation and released by DreamWorks Pictures, it was the third animated feature produced by the studio.
The Road to El Dorado was theatrically released in the United States on March 31, 2000, received mixed reviews from critics and performed poorly at the box office, grossing $76 million worldwide on a production budget of about $95 million. Zimmer's work on the score, however, received praise and earned him the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Score alongside his work on Gladiator at the 6th Critics' Choice Awards. Despite its initial reception, reevaluation in later years has resulted in The Road to El Dorado becoming a cult classic.
2025-04-19 21:34:32 - Act 3: Thought 2: The search results mention that the main stars of the film are Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Rosie Perez, Armand Assante, and Edward James Olmos. It does not mention Tim Allen as one of the stars.

Claim: The highest point of the Hindu Kush is Everest.

>

2025-04-19 21:36:04 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to find information about the highest point of the Hindu Kush and compare it to Mount Everest.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:36:11 - Act 2: Search[Hindu Kush]
Obs 2: The Hindu Kush is an 800-kilometre-long (500 mi) mountain range in Central and South Asia to the west of the Himalayas. It stretches from central and eastern Afghanistan into northwestern Pakistan and far southeastern Tajikistan. The range forms the western section of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Region (HKH); to the north, near its northeastern end, the Hindu Kush buttresses the Pamir Mountains near the point where the borders of China, Pakistan and Afghanistan meet, after which it runs southwest through Pakistan and into Afghanistan near their border. 
The eastern end of the Hindu Kush in the north merges with the Karakoram Range. Towards its southern end, it connects with the White Mountains near the Kabul River. It divides the valley of the Amu Darya (the ancient Oxus) to the north from the Indus River valley to the south. The range has numerous high snow-capped peaks, with the highest point being Tirich Mir or Terichmir at 7,708 metres (25,289 ft) in the Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.
The Hindu Kush range region was a historically significant center of Buddhism, with sites such as the Bamiyan Buddhas. The range and communities settled in it hosted ancient monasteries, important trade networks and travelers between Central Asia and South Asia. While the vast majority of the region has been majority-Muslim for several centuries now, certain portions of the Hindu Kush only became Islamized relatively recently, such as Kafiristan, which retained ancient polytheistic beliefs until the 19th century when it was converted to Islam by the Durrani Empire and renamed Nuristan ("land of light"). The Hindu Kush range has also been the passageway for invasions of the Indian subcontinent, and continues to be important to contemporary warfare in Afghanistan.

The simultaneous release of her second studio album, J.Lo, and the film, The Wedding Planner, in January 2001, made Lopez the first entertainer to have a number one film and album in the United States in the same week. The album was certified four-times platinum in the United States and yielded four hit singles, including "Love Don't Cost a Thing" and "I'm Real", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The following year saw the release of Lopez's remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes (2002), which became the first remix album in history to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, and went on to become one of the best selling remix albums of all time. Three singles were released from the album, including "Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks.
Lopez's third studio album, This Is Me... Then (2002), reached number two on the Billboard 200, and earned double-platinum status in the United States. Four singles were released from the album, including the hits "Jenny from the Block" and "All I Have", which topped the charts in the United States and New Zealand. Her fourth studio album, Rebirth (2005), charted moderately in the United States, eventually earning a platinum certification. It produced two singles, including its lead single, "Get Right", which went number one in five countries. Lopez's first full-length Spanish album, Como Ama una Mujer, was released in March 2007 and peaked at number ten on the US Billboard 200. Two singles were released from the album, most notably "Qué Hiciste", which was an international success and was certified eight-times platinum in Spain. A little over six months later, the singer released her sixth studio album, Brave (2007), which became her first album to miss the top ten on the Billboard 200. Just like the album, its lead single, "Do It Well", was only a moderate success.
Following a move to Island Records from Sony Music, Lopez released her seventh studio album, Love?, in May 2011, which was a moderately successful, but brief, comeback for her. Three singles were released from the album, including "On the Floor", which became the singer's most successful single in her career. The song topped more than eighteen national charts and sold more than 8.4 million digital copies globally, making it the best-selling single of 2011 by a female artist. Lopez's first greatest hits album, Dance Again... the Hits (2012), followed a year later and produced the international hit "Dance Again". Her eighth studio album, A.K.A., was released in June 2014 by Capitol Records and became her lowest-selling album in the US. Three singles were released from the album, including "Booty", which reached the top 20 in Canada and the United States. After A.K.A.'s underperformance, Lopez then departed from the label and returned to Epic Records. Instead of releasing studio albums, she released several standalone singles such as "Ain't Your Mama", "Dinero" and "Pa' Ti". In 2022, in collaboration with Maluma, she released a movie soundtrack. In 2024, she released a sequel album to This Is Me... Then entitled This Is Me... Now, her first studio album in a decade.
> Thought 3: The observation clearly states that Jennifer Lopez has released 66 singles (including 14 as a featured artist). This confirms that she has indeed made a single.
OK.

Claim: Same Old Love is disassociated from Selena Gomez.

>

2025-04-19 21:36:55 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about the song "Same Old Love" and its association with Selena Gomez.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:37:00 - Act 2: Search[Same Old Love]
Obs 2: "Same Old Love" is a song recorded by American singer Selena Gomez, who included it on and released it from her second studio album Revival (2015). The song was written by Charli XCX, Ross Golan, and its producers Stargate and Benny Blanco. The song was released as the second single from Revival on September 10, 2015, to contemporary hit radio. It was initially composed by XCX with Stargate and later recorded by Gomez without the former in the studio at the time. "Same Old Love" is a midtempo electropop and synth-pop song backed by a wonky piano loop, a finger-click beat and Italo disco synths. In the song, Gomez uses a forceful, emotive tone and a raspy delivery that are both uncharacteristic for her, accompanied by XCX's chorus vocals. According to Gomez, the lyrics are a representation of various stages of different relationships and are about getting rid of everything toxic in her life, also inspired by her relationship with her father.
A number of remixes were commissioned for its release, including an official remix featuring rapper Fetty Wap. Music critics mostly complimented its catchy tune and understated, moody sound. The song peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, marking Gomez's fourth top ten and second consecutive top five single from the album. "Same Old Love" also reached number one on the US Pop Airplay chart and the top ten in Canada, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
"Same Old Love" was accompanied by a music video directed by Michael Haussman and filmed in the Broadway Theater District of Los Angeles. It premiered as an Apple Music exclusive on September 22, 2015, and was released on Vevo channel on October 7, 2015. The video was well received by critics who complimented Gomez's styling and the emotional storyline. It was inspired by Gomez's relationships with her loved ones and fans. It featured Gomez witnessing several dramatic vignettes on the streets of Los Angeles, and performing at a theater. Gomez promoted "Same Old Love" with several televised performances, including on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and at the 2015 American Music Awards.
2025-04-19 21:37:03 - Act 3: Thought 2: The observation clearly states that "Same Old Love" is a song recorded by Selena Gomez and included on her second studio album Revival (2015). This directly associates the song with Selena Gomez, so the claim that it is disassociated from her is false.
Obs 3: OK.

Claim: Aristotle spent time in Athens.
- Environment feedback
You successfully finished this task.
    

### Key steps:
Search for Information: Look up information about Aristotle and his life.
Find Relevant Information: Identify that Aristotle joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. BC).
Conclude: Determine that Aristotle spent time in Athens based on the found information.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about Aristotle and his time in Athens.
OK.
> Search[Aristotle]
Aristotle (Attic Greek: Ἀριστοτέλης, romanized: Aristotélēs; 384–322 BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher and polymath. His writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology, and the arts. As the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens, he began the wider Aristotelian tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern science.
Little is known about Aristotle's life. He was born in the city of Stagira in northern Greece during the Classical period. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At around eighteen years old, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven (c. 347 BC). Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored his son Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. He established a library in the Lyceum, which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls.
Though Aristotle wrote many treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. His teachings and methods of inquiry have had a significant impact across the world, and remain a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.
Aristotle's views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. The influence of his physical science extended from late antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and was not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed. He influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church.
Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as "The First Teacher", and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as simply "The Philosopher", while the poet Dante called him "the master of those who know". He has been referred to as the first scientist. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, and were studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and Jean Buridan. His influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. In addition, his ethics, although always influential, has gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics.
> Thought 2: From the observation, it mentions that Aristotle joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). This indicates that Aristotle spent time in Athens during his time at the Academy.
OK.

Claim: The heart beats at a resting rate close to 22 beats per minute.

>

2025-04-19 21:37:18 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about the resting heart rate of a human.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:37:24 - Act 2: Search[resting heart rate]
Obs 2: Heart rate is the frequency of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions of the heart per minute (beats per minute, or bpm). The heart rate varies according to the body's physical needs, including the need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide. It is also modulated by numerous factors, including (but not limited to) genetics, physical fitness, stress or psychological status, diet, drugs, hormonal status, environment, and disease/illness, as well as the interaction between these factors. It is usually equal or close to the pulse rate measured at any peripheral point.
The American Heart Association states the normal resting adult human heart rate is 60–100 bpm. An ultra-trained athlete would have a resting heart rate of 37–38 bpm. Tachycardia is a high heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest. Bradycardia is a low heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest. When a human sleeps, a heartbeat with rates around 40–50 bpm is common and considered normal. When the heart is not beating in a regular pattern, this is referred to as an arrhythmia. Abnormalities of heart rate sometimes indicate disease.
2025-04-19 21:37:27 - Act 3: Thought 2: The observation mentions that the normal resting adult human heart rate is 60–100 bpm, and an ultra-trained athlete would have a resting heart rate of 37–38 bpm. However, it does not specify a specific resting rate close to 22 bpm.

2025-04-19 21:37:56 - Act 4: Search[Yoo Jae Suk]
Obs 4: Could not find [Yoo Jae Suk]. Similar: ['Yoo Jae-suk', 'List of awards and nominations received by Yoo Jae-suk', 'Yoo Yeon-seok', 'List of Hangout with Yoo episodes', 'List of Yoo Jae-suk performances', 'List of Running Man episodes (2024)', 'Hangout with Yoo', 'Jae-suk', 'List of Running Man episodes (2019)', 'List of Running Man episodes (2023)']
2025-04-19 21:37:59 - Act 5: Thought 3: Since the search for Yoo Jae Suk did not yield any direct information about his hosting of Weekly Idol, I should look up "Yoo Jae-suk" to see if he has any connection to the show.
Obs 5: OK.
2025-04-19 21:38:04 - Act 6: Search[Yoo Jae-suk]
Obs 6: Could not find [Yoo Jae-suk].

2025-04-19 21:38:09 - Act 7: Thought 4: The search for Yoo Jae-suk still did not provide any direct information about his hosting of Weekly Idol. However, I can infer that if Yoo Jae-suk is not mentioned as a host of Weekly Idol, the claim is likely false. I should now look up "Yoo Jae-suk" to see if he has any connection to any other shows or if there is any mention of him hosting Weekly Idol.
Obs 7: OK.
2025-04-19 21:38:10 - Act 8: Search[Yoo Jae-suk]
Obs 8: Could not find [Yoo Jae-suk].

2025-04-19 21:38:16 - Act 9: Thought 5: Since the search for Yoo Jae-suk still did not provide any direct information about his hosting of Weekly Idol, and the previous searches have not yielded any relevant information, I should conclude that the claim is likely false. However, to be thorough, I should look up "Running Man" to see if Yoo Jae-suk is a host of that show, as he is a well-known figure in South Korean entertainment and might be more prominently featured in his other shows.
Obs 9: OK.
2025-04-19 21:38:21 - Act 10: Search[Running Man]
Obs 10: The Running Man is an upcoming dystopian action thriller film produced and directed by Edgar Wright from a screenplay he co-wrote with Michael Bacall, based on the 1982 novel of the same name by Stephen King (under his pseudonym Richard Bachman). It is the second adaptation of the book following the 1987 film and stars Glen Powell, Katy O'Brian, Daniel Ezra, Karl Glusman, Josh Brolin, Lee Pace, Jayme Lawson, Michael Cera, Emilia Jones, William H. Macy, David Zayas, Sean Hayes, and Colman Domingo. The film is scheduled to be released by Paramount Pictures on November 7, 2025.
2025-04-19 21:38:24 - Act 11: Thought 6: The search for "Running Man" did not provide any information about Yoo Jae-suk hosting the show. Since the searches for both "Weekly Idol" and "Yoo Jae-suk" have not yielded any direct information supporting the claim, and given the lack of any mention of Yoo Jae-suk as a host of Weekly Idol, I can conclude that the claim is false.
Obs 11: OK.
2025-04-19 21:38:27 - Act 12: Thought 7: Given the lack of any direct information supporting the claim and the multiple searches that did not yield any relevant results, I can conclude that the claim is false. Yoo Jae-suk is not mentioned as a host of Weekly Idol in the information provided, and there is no other evidence to support the claim.
Obs 12: OK.

Claim: Heavy Metal music was developed in the early 1970's.

>

2025-04-19 21:38:47 - Act 1: Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for information about the development of Heavy Metal music in the early 1970s.
Obs 1: OK.
2025-04-19 21:38:53 - Act 2: Search[Heavy Metal music]
Obs 2: Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and United States. With roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock and acid rock, heavy metal bands developed a thick, monumental sound characterized by distorted guitars, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats and loudness.
In 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers – British bands Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple – were founded. Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and shock rock of Alice Cooper and Kiss; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith; and the flashy guitar leads and party rock of Van Halen. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence, while Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as "metalheads" or "headbangers". The lyrics of some metal genres became associated with aggression and machismo, an issue that has at times led to accusations of misogyny.
During the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Bon Jovi, Mötley Crüe and Poison. Meanwhile, however, underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres such as death metal and black metal became – and remain – subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles have expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal and nu metal, the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip-hop.
2025-04-19 21:38:58 - Act 3: Thought 2: The observation mentions that heavy metal developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which aligns with the claim. However, it also provides more context about the development of the genre during the 1970s, including the formation of famous bands like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple. This information supports the claim that heavy metal was developed in the early 1970s.

Claim: Saxony is in Ireland.

You successfully finished this task.
    

### Key steps:
Search for Information: Look up information about Saxony.
Find Information: Learn that Saxony is a region in northern Germany, not in Ireland.
Conclude: Understand that the claim that Saxony is in Ireland is false.

### Detailed trajectory:
> Thought 1: To verify this claim, I need to search for Saxony to find information about its location.
OK.
> Search[Saxony]
The Saxons, sometimes called the Old Saxons or Continental Saxons, were a Germanic people of early medieval "Old" Saxony (Latin: Antiqua Saxonia) which became a Carolingian "stem duchy" in 804, in what is now northern Germany. Many of their neighbours were, like them, speakers of West Germanic dialects, including the inland Franks and Thuringians to the south, and the coastal Frisians and Angles to the north who were among the peoples who were originally referred to as "Saxons" in the context of early raiding and settlements in Roman Britain and Gaul. To their east were Obotrites and other Slavic-speaking peoples.
The political history of these continental Saxons is unclear until the 8th century and the conflict between their semi-legendary hero Widukind and the Frankish emperor Charlemagne. They do not appear to have been politically united until about the generations leading up to that conflict, and before then they were reportedly ruled by regional "satraps". Previous Frankish rulers of Austrasia, both Merovingian and Carolingian, fought numerous campaigns against Saxons, both in the west near the Lippe, Ems and Weser, and further east, near Thuringia and Bohemia, in the area which later medieval sources referred to as "North Swabia". 
Charlemagne conquered all the Saxons after winning the long Saxon Wars (772–804) and forced them to convert to Christianity, annexing Saxony into the Carolingian domain. Under the Carolingian Franks, Saxony became a single duchy, fitting it within the basic political structure of the later Holy Roman Empire. The early rulers of this Duchy of Saxony expanded their territories—and therefore those of the Holy Roman Empire—to the east, at the expense of Slavic-speaking Wends. 
Long before any clear historical mention of Saxony as a state, the name "Saxons" was also used to refer to coastal raiders who attacked the Roman Empire from north of the Rhine, in a similar sense to the much later term Viking. These early raiders and settlers included Frisians, Angles and Jutes, and the term Saxon was not at that time a term for any specific tribe. There is however a single possible classical reference to a smaller and much earlier Saxon tribe, but the interpretation of this text ("Axones" in most surviving manuscripts) is disputed. According to this proposal, the original Saxon tribe lived north of the mouth of the Elbe, close to the probable homeland of the Angles, in the Saxon area which came to be known later as Nordalbingia.
Today the Saxons of Germany no longer form a distinctive ethnic group or country, but their name lives on in the names of several regions and states of Germany, including Lower Saxony (German: Niedersachsen) which includes most of the original duchy. Their language evolved into Low German which was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League, but has faced a long and gradual decline since the Late Medieval period as a literary, administrative and, to a significant extent, cultural language in favor of Dutch and German.

OK.

The Saxons, sometimes called the Old Saxons or Continental Saxons, were a Germanic people of early medieval "Old" Saxony (Latin: Antiqua Saxonia) which became a Carolingian "stem duchy" in 804, in what is now northern Germany. Many of their neighbours were, like them, speakers of West Germanic dialects, including the inland Franks and Thuringians to the south, and the coastal Frisians and Angles to the north who were among the peoples who were originally referred to as "Saxons" in the context of early raiding and settlements in Roman Britain and Gaul. To their east were Obotrites and other Slavic-speaking peoples.
The political history of these continental Saxons is unclear until the 8th century and the conflict between their semi-legendary hero Widukind and the Frankish emperor Charlemagne. They do not appear to have been politically united until about the generations leading up to that conflict, and before then they were reportedly ruled by regional "satraps". Previous Frankish rulers of Austrasia, both Merovingian and Carolingian, fought numerous campaigns against Saxons, both in the west near the Lippe, Ems and Weser, and further east, near Thuringia and Bohemia, in the area which later medieval sources referred to as "North Swabia". 
Charlemagne conquered all the Saxons after winning the long Saxon Wars (772–804) and forced them to convert to Christianity, annexing Saxony into the Carolingian domain. Under the Carolingian Franks, Saxony became a single duchy, fitting it within the basic political structure of the later Holy Roman Empire. The early rulers of this Duchy of Saxony expanded their territories—and therefore those of the Holy Roman Empire—to the east, at the expense of Slavic-speaking Wends. 
Long before any clear historical mention of Saxony as a state, the name "Saxons" was also used to refer to coastal raiders who attacked the Roman Empire from north of the Rhine, in a similar sense to the much later term Viking. These early raiders and settlers included Frisians, Angles and Jutes, and the term Saxon was not at that time a term for any specific tribe. There is however a single possible classical reference to a smaller and much earlier Saxon tribe, but the interpretation of this text ("Axones" in most surviving manuscripts) is disputed. According to this proposal, the original Saxon tribe lived north of the mouth of the Elbe, close to the probable homeland of the Angles, in the Saxon area which came to be known later as Nordalbingia.
Today the Saxons of Germany no longer form a distinctive ethnic group or country, but their name lives on in the names of several regions and states of Germany, including Lower Saxony (German: Niedersachsen) which includes most of the original duchy. Their language evolved into Low German which was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League, but has faced a long and gradual decline since the Late Medieval period as a literary, administrative and, to a significant extent, cultural language in favor of Dutch and German.
> Thought 2: The observation mentions that Saxony is a region in northern Germany, not in Ireland. Therefore, the claim that Saxony is in Ireland is false.
OK.

The Vedas ( or ; Sanskrit: वेदः, romanized: Vēdaḥ, lit. 'knowledge'), sometimes collectively called the Veda, are a large body of religious texts originating in ancient India. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism.
There are four Vedas: the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda. Each Veda has four subdivisions – the Samhitas (mantras and benedictions), the Brahmanas (commentaries on and explanation of rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices – Yajñas), the Aranyakas (text on rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices), and the Upanishads (texts discussing meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge). Some scholars add a fifth category – the Upāsanās (worship). The texts of the Upanishads discuss ideas akin to the heterodox sramana traditions. The Samhitas and Brahmanas describe daily rituals and are generally meant for the Brahmacharya and Gr̥hastha stages of the Chaturashrama system, while the Aranyakas and Upanishads are meant for the Vānaprastha and Sannyasa stages, respectively.
Vedas are śruti ("what is heard"), distinguishing them from other religious texts, which are called smr̥ti ("what is remembered"). Hindus consider the Vedas to be apauruṣeya, which means "not of a man, superhuman" and "impersonal, authorless", revelations of sacred sounds and texts heard by ancient sages after intense meditation.
The Vedas have been orally transmitted since the 2nd millennium BCE with the help of elaborate mnemonic techniques. The mantras, the oldest part of the Vedas, are recited in the modern age for their phonology rather than the semantics, and are considered to be "primordial rhythms of creation", preceding the forms to which they refer. By reciting them the cosmos is regenerated, "by enlivening and nourishing the forms of creation at their base."
The various Indian philosophies and Hindu sects have taken differing positions on the Vedas. Schools of Indian philosophy that acknowledge the importance or primal authority of the Vedas comprise Hindu philosophy specifically and are together classified as the six "orthodox" (āstika) schools. However, śramaṇa traditions, such as Charvaka, Ajivika, Buddhism, and Jainism, which did not regard the Vedas as authoritative, are referred to as "heterodox" or "non-orthodox" (nāstika) schools.
> Thought 2: The search result does not mention Christopher Nolan or any film named Vedam. It seems to be about the ancient Indian scriptures called the Vedas. I need to search for "Vedam (film)" to find information about a potential film.
OK.
> Search[Vedam (film)]
Vedam (transl. Chant) is a 2010 Indian Telugu-language melodrama anthology hyperlink film written and directed by Krish, and produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni under their banner Arka Media Works. The film features an ensemble cast consisting of Allu Arjun, Manchu Manoj, Anushka Shetty, Manoj Bajpayee, Saranya Ponvannan, Nagayya, Deeksha Seth, and Lekha Washington. M. M. Keeravani composed the music while Gnana Shekar V. S. did the cinematography.
Broadly falling into the hyperlink cinema genre, the film was critically acclaimed and won multiple awards, including four Filmfare Awards (Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress). Film Companion included Vedam in their list of 25 Greatest Telugu Films Of The Decade. Krish later remade the film in Tamil as Vaanam (2011).

Obs 13: Tool is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1990. It consists of vocalist Maynard James Keenan, guitarist Adam Jones, drummer Danny Carey and bassist Justin Chancellor, who replaced founding member Paul D'Amour in 1995. Tool has won four Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping charts in several countries.
The band has released five studio albums, one EP and one box set. They emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, Undertow (1993), and became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their follow-up album Ænima in 1996. The group's efforts to combine musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued with Lateralus (2001) and 10,000 Days (2006), gaining critical acclaim and international commercial success. Their fifth studio album Fear Inoculum was released on August 30, 2019, to widespread critical acclaim. Prior to its release, the band had sold more than 13 million albums in the US alone.
Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band has been described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between the band and the music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship, and the band's insistence on privacy.
